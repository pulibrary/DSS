Also includes 80 oversampled Jewish households, not nationally representative, bringing the total number of completed cases to 3,370.  Purpose is to research the shape & influence of religion & spirituality in the lives of American youth; to identify effective practices in the religious, moral, and social formation of the lives of youth; to describe the extent & perceived effectiveness of the programs & opportunities that religious communities are offering to their youth; and to foster an informed national discussion about the influence of religion in youth's lives, in order to encourage sustained reflection about and rethinking of our cultural and institutional practices with regard to youth & religion.  The 2nd wave was designed to be a re-interview of all <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW1.asp\\'>Wave 1</a> youth survey respondents. Parents of the youth respondents were not re-interviewed. At the time of the 2nd survey, respondents were between the ages of 16-21. Conducted from June 9-November 24, 2005. <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW2.asp\\'>2nd wave</a> interviews were conducted only in English. Four youth respondents did not participate in the Wave 2 interview due to not being able to understand or speak English. Wave 2 covers many of the same topics as Wave 1. Many of the questions are identical. However, Wave 2 was re-designed to take into account changes in the lives of the respondents as they began to enter young adulthood. Wave 2 included new questions pertaining to behaviors occurring during the transition to adulthood, such as non-marital cohabitation, educational and career aspirations, pregnancy and marriage.  In <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW3.asp\\'>Wave 3</a> every attempt was made to re-interview all English-speaking Wave 1 youth survey respondents. At the time of the 3rd survey, respondents were between the ages of 18-24. Conducted from September 24, 2007-April 21, 2008.  Wave 3 replicated many of the questions asked in Waves 1 & 2 with some changes made to better capture the respondents' lives as they grew older. For example, there were fewer questions on parental monitoring and more on post-high school educational aspirations.       <li><a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Middletown.asp\\'>Middletown Area Studies</a> - Data were collected from 1978 to 2004.

Long running surveys dating back to 1973.    <li><a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Sfocus.asp\\'>Southern Focus Polls</a> - Southerners tend to slip through the cracks between state surveys, which are unreliable for generalizing to the region, on the one hand, and national sample surveys, which usually contain too few Southerners to allow detailed examination, on the other. Moreover, few surveys routinely include questions specifically about the South. To remedy this situation, the Institute for Research in Social Science and the Center for the Study of the American South sponsor a Southern regional survey, called the Southern Focus Poll. Respondents in both the South and non-South are asked questions about economic conditions in their communities, cultural issues (such as Southern accent and the Confederate flag), race relations, religious involvement, and characteristics of Southerners and Northerners.   <li>Survey of American Catholic Priests - Priests were surveyed about satisfaction with their training, their Presbyteral Council, and particularly their priestly ministry.  Topics include their views on church authority, the role of the laity, the challenges of the priestly life, public perceptions of the priesthood, and sexuality.  Survey results for <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/PRIEST85.asp\\'>1985</a>, <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/PRIEST93.asp\\'>1993</a>, and <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/PRIEST01.asp\\'>2001</a> are available.  <li>System for Catholic Research, Information and Planning - The aim was to develop a dataset describing the U.S. Catholic Church at the diocesan level.  Diocesan information collected from Church and other sources were merged with U.S. Census data describing population and other characteristics of the counties that make up each diocese.

Three types of surveys were completed in each participating congregation: (a) an attender survey completed by all worshipers age 15 and older who attended worship services during the weekend the survey was given; (b) a congregational profile describing the congregation's facilities, staff, programs, and worship services completed by one person in the congregation; and a leader survey completed by the pastor, priest, minister, rabbi, or other principal leader.

Respondents were asked if they aligned themselves with a party or a candidate, for whom they voted, and their level of involvement or previous experience in any party or candidate's political campaign. At the national level, respondents were asked for their opinions on the Indian Congress, its role and strength in the government, actions taken and legislation passed by the Congress and the level of involvement it should take concerning bovine issues.

Most surveys with good data on fertility and fertility-related behavior lacked measures of female autonomy and the roles played by women within households and communities. In an effort to redress this gap in the available data base, a team of researchers was assembled in the late 1980s to do a set of comparative studies in Thailand, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Pakistan. After some preliminary studies and consultation, it was resolved to do larger scale surveys in each country, with samples of women and their husbands drawn from purposively selected communities, defined in different ways in different countries. The focus on communities was motivated by a recognition that many of the most salient theoretical ideas concerning the status of women and fertility were best operationalized at this macro level (Smith, 1989). The studies themselves were fielded in 1993 and 1994.","2011-08-03 14:07:31",,"Smith, Herbert L., Sharon J. Ghuman, Helen J.

One of very few long- standing longitudinal cohort studies in a poor Sub-Saharan African (SSA) context. It provides a rare record of more than a decade of demographic, socioeconomic, and health conditions in one of the world's poorest countries. The MLSFH cohorts were selected to represent the rural population of Malawi, where the vast majority of Malawians live in conditions that are similar to those in the rural areas of other countries with high HIV prevalence: health conditions are poor, health facilities and schools are over-burdened and under-staffed, standards of living are low and nutritional needs of adults, children and the elderly are often not met. With 7 major data collection rounds between 1998 and 2012 for up to 4,000 individuals, as well as ancillary surveys and qualitative studies, the MLSFH has been a premier dataset for research on health, family dynamics, social networks, and HIV infection risks in a rural SSA context. Providing public-use data on the socioeconomic context, demographics and health of individuals and their families in Malawi over more than a decade, the MLSFH has been the basis of more than 150 publications and working papers submitted for publication. Importantly, the MLSFH has also informed health policy discussions in Malawi and elsewhere in SSA. The MLSFH/MDICP was originally developed as a sister project of the Kenya Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (KDICP), but with a larger sample and greater geographical dispersion. Both the KDICP and the MLSFH/MDICP aimed to examine the role of social interactions in changing demographic attitudes and behavior.  The first 2 waves of the MLSFH data collected in 1998 and 2001 are archived and available for download at ICPSR-DSDR. The first 2 waves focused on two key empirical questions: the roles of social interactions in (1) the acceptance (or rejection) of modern contraceptive methods and of smaller ideal family size and (2) the diffusion of knowledge of AIDS symptoms and transmission mechanisms and the evaluation of acceptable strategies of protection against AIDS.","2014-11-10 16:02:47",,,,,,,"Single study"

The idea was to study these topics within as natural a setting as possible and to analyze how infant feeding decisions by the household interact with various social, economic, and environmental factors to affect health, nutritional, demographic, and economic outcomes.

As part of NEWWS, the effects of two approaches to preparing welfare recipients for employment were compared in three sites (Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside). In one approach, the human capital development approach, individuals were directed to avail themselves of education services and, to a lesser extent, occupational training before they sought work, under the theory that they would then be able to get better jobs and keep them longer. In the other approach, the labor force attachment approach, individuals were encouraged to gain quick entry into the labor market, even at low wages, under the theory that their work habits and skills would improve on the job and they would thereby be able to advance themselves.

Information has been collected from parents when the children were aged 9 months and at around 3 years of age. The sample design allowed for disproportionate representation of families living in areas of child poverty, in the smaller countries of the UK and in areas with high ethnic minority populations in England.  The first survey recorded the circumstances of pregnancy and birth, as well as those of the all-important early months of life, and the social and economic background of the family into which the children have been born. The main objectives of the second survey were to chart continuity and change in the child's family and parenting environment, to assess key aspects of the child's physical, cognitive, social and emotional development and to maximise longitudinal potential for predicting and explaining future development.  The study's broad objective is to create a new multi-purpose longitudinal dataset, describing the diversity of backgrounds from which children born in the new century are setting out on life.

Although the HTHS questionnaires are similar to the CTS Household Survey questionnaires, the HTHS sampling design does not have the community focus intrinsic to CTS. Whereas the CTS design focused on 60 nationally representative communities with sample sizes large enough to draw conclusions about health system change in 12 communities, the HTHS design is a national sample not aimed at measuring change within communities. Hence, Community was dropped from the study title. Like the CTS Household Surveys, HTHS collected information on health insurance coverage, use of health services, health expenses, satisfaction with health care and physician choice, unmet health care needs, usual source of care and patient trust, health status, adult chronic conditions, height and weight, and smoking behavior. In addition, the survey inquired about perceptions of care delivery and quality, problems with paying medical bills, use of in-store retail and onsite workplace health clinics, patient engagement with health care, sources of health information, and shopping for health care.  Domestic partners are included in the same (family insurance unit) FIU since many health insurance policies now cover them.

Midlife, the years between 30 and 70, is perhaps the least studied and most ill-defined of any period of life. It abounds with changing images and myths, such as the \\'midlife crisis,\\' the \\'change of life,\\' the \\'empty nest syndrome,\\' and many more. However, there has been little documentation about what really happens, biologically and psychologically, during this extended period of time. The primary objective is to identify the major biomedical, psychological, and social factors that permit some people to achieve good health, psychological well-being, and social responsiblity during their adult years. To do this, MIDMAC collected a series of data to establish an empirical basis for documenting what really happens in the middle years and to identify the factors that determine the course of midlife development. The first wave of data collection (MIDUS I) began in 1995 with a National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. The main data collection consisted of a general population survey, as well as surveys of siblings of the general population respondents, and a twin pairs sample. The main data collection also included an oversample of five metropolitan areas. In addition to the main national survey, random subsamples of respondents were recruited to participate in in-depth investigations of selected topics, such as management strategies for coping with stressful experiences, a national study of daily experiences, and a study of psychological experiences.

461,"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and Followup Series (1971+)","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/39","The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I, II, III, Hispanic HANES, and NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Survey [NHEFS]) were designed to obtain information on the health and nutritional status of the United States population. The NHANES I and NHANES II datasets were formerly titled <i>Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys</i>. This series succeeds the <a href=\\'http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00197\\'target=\\'_blank\\'><i>National  Health Examination Survey</i></a>, which was collected from 1959 to 1970. All of the NHANES datasets use complex, multistage, stratified, clustered samples of civilian noninstitutionalized populations. All of the files within each study are linkable to each other. NHANES I (1971-1975) interviewed persons aged 1-74 years. The sample was selected so that certain population groups thought to be at high risk of malnutrition (persons with low incomes, preschool children, women of childbearing age, and the elderly) were oversampled at preset rates. On completion of the survey, 23,808 of the interviewed sample were given a medical examination, and this information is also part of the NHANES I data collections. The NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) is a longitudinal study designed to investigate the relationships between clinical, nutritional, and behavioral factors assessed in NHANES I and subsequent morbidity, mortality, and hospital utilization, as well as changes in risk factors, functional limitation, and institutionalization. The NHEFS cohort includes all persons aged 25-74 who completed a medical examination for NHANES I (N = 14,407). NHANES II (1976-1980), was designed to continue the measurement and monitoring of the nutritional status and health of the United States population. From the sample of 27,801 persons aged 6 months to 74 years, 25,286 people were interviewed and 20,322 were both interviewed and examined. Because children and persons classified as living at or below the poverty level were assumed to be at special risk of having nutritional problems, they were sampled at rates substantially higher than their proportions in the general population. NHANES III (1988-1994) contains information on a sample of 33,994 persons aged 2 months and older. A home examination was employed for the first time in order to obtain examination data for very young children and for the elderly. The Hispanic HANES (HHANES) was conducted to obtain sufficient numbers to produce estimates of the health and nutritional status of Hispanics in general, as well as specific data for Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans, and Cuban Americans.

Provides a continuous sampling and interviewing of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States.  Supplemental data provide information on topics such as AIDS knowledge and attitudes, child health care and immunization, dental care, substance abuse, hospitalization, preventive care, nursing care, prosthetic appliances, and self-care. Supplements on Aging (SOA) conducted in 1984 and 1994 and the 1984-1990 Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) were designed to furnish information on the causes and correlates of changes in the health and functioning of older Americans. Another component is the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D). Begun in 1994, the NHIS-D was designed to collect data that can be used to understand disability and to develop public policy on disability. Starting in 1997, the NHIS was redesigned to include a basic module, a periodic module, and a topical module. The basic module corresponds to the NHIS core questionnaire and is made up of the family core, the sample adult core, and the sample child core questions. The periodic module provides more detailed information on topics resulting from the basic module. The topical modules correspond to the supplements of the 1982-1996 NHIS and focus on public health data needs as they arise.  1987 and 1988 main surveys are not on ICPSR.

With the 1977 data, the title was expanded to Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data. Each year, participating law enforcement agencies contribute reports to the FBI either directly or through their state reporting programs. ICPSR archives the UCR data as 5 separate components: (1) summary data, (2) county-level data, (3) incident-level data (National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS]), (4) hate crime data, and (5) various, mostly nonrecurring, data collections. Summary data are reported in four types of files: (a) Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, (b) Property Stolen and Recovered, (c) Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), and (d) Police Employee (LEOKA) Data (Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted). County-level data provide counts of arrests and offenses aggregated to the county level. County populations are also reported. In the late 1970s, new ways to look at crime were studied. The UCR program was subsequently expanded to capture incident-level data with the implementation of the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The NIBRS data focus on various aspects of a crime incident. Gathering of hate crime data by the UCR program was begun in 1990. Hate crimes are defined as crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In September 1994, disabilities, both physical and mental, were added to the list. The 5th component of ICPSR's UCR holdings is comprised of various collections, many of which are nonrecurring and prepared by individual researchers.

The aim of this data series was to provide a reliable, up-to-date, accessible database on women in development which can illuminate the discrepancies in the roles and status of women against those of men throughout the world in order to serve as a basis for the promotion of both intranational and international parity between the sexes. The studies that comprise the Women in Development series consist of national-level data concerning female/male differentials over a range of demographic and socio-economic variables. Wherever possible, the data are broken down by age and urban/rural residence to facilitate further analysis. The series is cumulative and the data are presented in basic tabular format. Initially, the data tables were compiled for 69 developing nations from Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Near East that were recipients of the United States Agency for International Development aid. The first collection, Women in Development, 1979-1980 (ICPSR 8053), included all the aid-recipient nations regardless of population size. Subsequently, data were compiled for all remaining nations of the world with a population of five million or more, and statistics for the original nations were updated to reflect more recent information. The second collection in the series, Women in Development IV, 1983 (ICPSR 8155), covered approximately 120 nations from Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Near East, North America, Europe, and the Soviet Union.","2011-05-17 09:50:52",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Respondents were queried on such topics as caste, gender, age, marital status, education, residence, primary, secondary, and tertiary occupations, location of occupation, years employed at occupation, income, work habits, and job classification. Families reported on their size and composition, members living outside the village, economic relationships with others, acquisition, size, and construction of housing unit, and home improvements. Information was also gathered on family income sources and, in particular, on the amount of money and goods remitted to the village by family members living and working in Bombay. Agricultural issues explored include family labor provided for farming, amount of irrigated and non-irrigated land, productivity of the land, and the type, number, and location of livestock.","2011-06-17 13:44:11",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Follows the same design as Bicol Multipurpose Survey, 1978, with the data being organized into 31 ''blocks'' or series of questions. Respondents were again asked about income, employment, education, health status, and health services. Additionally, the 1983 survey gathered extensive information on fishing, business expenses, and small business activities, along with fertility, pregnancy, and mortality histories. Due to time and cost considerations, detailed questions on credit, some health-related items regarding beliefs, chronic illnesses, and breast-feeding, and detailed questions on crops were not included in the 1983 BMS. Section I, Household Data (Parts 1-32), focused on background information, transportation, environment, morbidity, and health services. Information was gathered about people living in the household six months prior to the survey as well as people who had left the household five years prior to the survey. Expenditure data on schooling were gathered for individuals 6-30 years of age. Marriage and pregnancy histories were elicited from women aged 15-49 along with family planning and birth interval information. Section II, Agriculture/Income/Labor Data (Parts 33-87), posed questions on employment, wages, and hired labor for men, women, and children aged 6-15. Data on coconut, sugar cane, and abaca crop production were also gathered, along with information about livestock and poultry, and extensive data were collected about fishing activities. Fishing boat owners were interviewed, along with capture fisherman who fished both inland and marine waters. The Barangay Survey (Parts 88-96) provided information about characteristics of the barangay in which the respondent lived (a barangay is a political subdivision equivalent to a village in rural areas and to a neighborhood in urban areas), services available in the community, types of social services or practitioners, the availability of public utilities and transportation, different types of organizations present within the barangay, employment conditions, and environmental sanitation conditions.","2011-06-17 13:45:39","A total of 1,901 households were surveyed in 1983, most of which were previously surveyed in 1978.

The survey gathered data for 17 project areas and 3 cities in the provinces of Albay, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon. Household-level information (Part 1) covers household characteristics, physical environment, income and expenditures, distance from schools, and respondents' feelings about household conditions and the progress of the barangay in which they lived (a barangay is a political subdivision equivalent to a village in rural areas and to a neighborhood in urban areas). Information on topics such as attitudes about foods during pregnancy, infant and child care, prenatal care, community involvement, and work history are contained in a separate Mothers Data file (Part 2). The individual-level data (Parts 3-5) contain demographic information such as age, sex, and education, and include time spent on household and occupational tasks. Information was collected from persons as young as 6 years of age, but was coded for individuals 15 years and older for tasks such as selling, food preparation, farm work, raising livestock and poultry, and the type and amount of fishing. Morbidity data from over 17,000 individuals are also included. The Household Production files (Parts 6-11) cover agriculture and business, crop production, rice farming, raising livestock and poultry, type of fishing done, and quantity of fish caught. Also included are income figures, assets, and liabilities. The Barangay Survey (Part 12) examines the physical aspects of the barangay and the use of social services in the area to determine the impact of the BRBDP and outside influences. The barangay captain or official records provided information on the physical characteristics, community services, medical services, social services, sanitation, and educational systems available within the barangay. The Extension Workers Survey (Part 13) asked 324 workers about their knowledge and activities regarding agricultural practices such as fertilizer use, pest and disease control, and other aspects of planting and transplanting. Through the Medical Practitioners Survey (Part 14), 426 practitioners were asked questions on their education and training, general health knowledge and experience, and knowledge and attitudes about birth control. Data collected in 1978, 1983, and 1994 can be used individually or merged together on a unique household identifier found in Part 15 (with the exception of the Medical Practitioners and Extension Workers data).","2011-06-17 13:45:57",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Coding of these characteristics yielded variables based on descriptions of worklife in specific organizational settings. The study data was collected in mainly two periods: the early 1990s and the early 2000s. The study generated 204 ethnographic cases. These cases were derived from 156 separate books since the observations reported in some books allowed the coding of multiple cases. The general scope of questions included organizational factors such as occupation, workplace organization, pay scheme, employment size, the situation of the company, the nature of company ownership, staff turnover, layoff frequency, how well the organization operated in terms of communications, recruitment and retention of personnel, and maintenance of equipment, as well as substantive facts concerning labor market opportunity, and labor force composition. On the topic of management, questions addressed leadership, organization of production, sexual harassment, and control strategies. Community factors were assessed through questions regarding unemployment and if the area was rural or urban. A series of questions addressed job satisfaction, pay, benefit package, job security, effort bargain, conflict with management/supervisors, training, worker strategies, conditions of consent/compliance, and nature of consent/compliance. The nature of work was queried through questions regarding autonomy, creativity, meaningful work, freedom of movement, comfort of work, injuries, employment status, and frequency of conflict with customers. Additional questions included size and nature of the focal group, group dynamics, conflict between the focal group and management, basis of alternative social groups at work, and if work friendships carried over to the outside. Questions about methodology covered ethnographer's theoretical orientation, focus of ethnography, ethnographer's gender, data collection method, supplemental data used, main type of supplemental data used, and position of key informant.

It also includes a categorical variable describing the direction of the intervention, i.e., whether it was launched in support of the target government, in opposition to the target government, or against some third party actor within the target state's borders. The intensity of the military intervention is captured in ordinal variables that document the scale of the actor's involvement, \\'ranging from minor engagement such as evacuation, to patrols, act of intimidation, and actual firing, shelling or bombing\\'. Casualties that are a direct result of the military intervention are coded as well. A novel aspect of IMI is the inclusion of a series of variables designed to ascertain the motivations or issues that prompted the actor to intervene, including to take sides in a domestic dispute in the target state, to affect target state policy, to protect a socio-ethnic or minority group, to attack rebels in sanctuaries in the target state, to protect economic or resource interests, to intervene for strategic purposes, to lend humanitarian aid, to acquire territory or to dispute its ownership, and to protect its own military/diplomatic interests. The variable, civilian casualties, which complements IMI's information on the casualties suffered by actor and target military personnel has been added.

665,"Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People (1988+)","http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/relatedStudyListForSN.asp?sn=6604","Began in 1982, under the name Smoking among Secondary Schoolchildren. The series initially aimed to provide national estimates of the proportion of secondary schoolchildren aged 11-15 who smoked, and to describe their smoking behavior. Similar surveys were carried out every 2 years until 1998 to monitor trends in the prevalence of cigarette smoking. The survey then moved to an annual cycle, and questions on alcohol consumption and drug use were included. The name of the series was changed to Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young Teenagers to reflect this widened focus. Since 1998, surveys have been carried out annually, with a core section of questions included on smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked in the last week; drinking status and amount of alcohol drunk in the last week; and awareness and use of drugs. For the 2000 survey, the series title again changed, to Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People. The Department of Health commissioned the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) to conduct the 2000 survey in England, and an equivalent survey was also conducted in Scotland. In alternate survey years, beyond the core questions, the remainder of the questionnaire focuses on either smoking and drinking or on drug taking. The 2001 and 2003 surveys focused mainly on drugs, and the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006 surveys focused mainly on smoking and drinking. It should be noted that the UK Data Archive (UKDA) only holds the survey from 1988 onwards. In some years, the surveys have been carried out in Scotland and Wales, as well as England, to provide separate national estimates for these countries. In 2002, a separate Scottish series, the <a href=\\'http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/relatedStudyListForSN.asp?sn=5826\\'target=\\'_blank\\'>Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey</a> was established to replace the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People series there, and to provide information in support of Scotland's new drugs strategy.

The party has a range of tools at its disposal to maintain its grip over government, but the key component of continued Leninist supervision is its control over the careers of the officials (cadres) that populate the government, public services, state-owned enterprises, the judiciary, the arms of representative government (people's congresses and political consultative conferences) and indeed the party apparatus itself. This study interrogates the efforts to use cadre training to standardize, modernize and sanitize the practice and ethos of administration. Cadres, while they continue to be bound by the ideology and practice prescribed by Leninist party discipline, should also become modern, competent managers of increasingly complex organizations.

1287,"Offshoring and Outsourcing Innovation? The New Challenge for Multinationals, 2007-2010","http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=6694","Western multinationals are now increasingly locating their research and development (R&D) activities in the emerging economies of China and India. This offshoring of innovation raises the following questions for policy makers and multinational firms: 1) What is the extent and nature of outsourcing and offshoring innovation, especially to emerging economies like India and China? 2) What are the main drivers of the globalisation of innovation?  Answering these questions involved collecting secondary data on the R&D locations of the world's largest multinationals. The sample covers a wide range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, engineering, and equipment manufacturing.  Data were collected in 4 steps. First, an in-depth search of corporate and subsidiary websites across individual countries was used to objectively identify the location and number of R&D facilities across nations. Second, these data were cross-checked and complemented with searches of the Factiva and Corporate Affiliations databases. Factiva provides news reports from global media, and includes reports of R&D activities. Corporate Affiliations is a repository of information of corporations' affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions worldwide. Third, a subset of these data were further cross-checked by matching the locations of R&D centres with the addresses of inventors of patents assigned in the last 3 years to these firms; the Delphion database and the US Patent and Trade Office website were used for these searches. Fourth, managers of individual firms were contacted to clarify contradictions.  Includes Fortune 500 companies listed in 2008 (excluding financial services firms) in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK & USA.These data are under embargo at the request of the depositor until 1 January 2012.

The European Parliament Research Group (EPRG) conducted two surveys of MEPs in 2000 and 2006. The 2000 survey was conducted in October-December 2000 and surveyed MEPs of the 5th European Parliament (1999-2004). The 2006 survey was conducted in March-June 2006 and surveyed MEPs of the 6th European Parliament (2004-09).  Includes the following categories of questions: personal details (member state, date first elected to EP, previous political experience), electoral systems and candidate selection, campaigning aims and activities  attitudes/behavior relating to representation, behavior in committees and voting in the Parliament, general political attitudes, attitudes towards specific EU policies, and attitudes towards EU institutional reform.

The inmates were matched using 6 criteria. Exact matches were made on race, gender, crime type, and category matches on age, time served, and number of disciplinary reports. A cluster sampling strategy was used for site selection. This strategy resulted in a selection of five states which were not identified in the study. The researchers then collected data on 6,464 individuals by completing record reviews of outcomes for the 3 matched samples, each of approximately 2,200 inmates released from 46 prisons across 5 PIECP states between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 2001. Variables include demographic information, time incarcerated, number of disciplinary reports, crime type, number of major disciplinary reports reviewed, group type, number of quarters from release to employment, censored variables, number of quarters from employed to job loss, time from release variables, number of possible follow-up quarters, proportion of follow-up time worked, wage variables, number of quarters worked variables, no work ever, and cluster number of case.","2009-02-04 15:11:14",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Variables measured in the original New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) include demographic characteristics; employment, marital, and childbearing histories; household composition; health; income and assets; program knowledge; and information about the spouses of married respondents.  The 1991 New Beneficiary Follow-up (NBF) updates marital status, household composition, and the economic profile and contains additional sections on family contacts, postretirement employment, effects of widowhood and divorce, major reasons for changes in economic status, a more extensive section on health, and information on household moves and reasons for moving. Disabled-worker beneficiaries were also asked about their efforts to return to work, experiences with rehabilitation services, and knowledge of SSA work incentive provisions.  The NBDS contains unique measurements that make it valuable not only for studies about Social Security but also for studies of health, economic, labor, gerontological, and welfare issues. It contains objective measures from administrative files of yearly covered earnings from 1951 to 1992, Medicare expenditures from 1984 to 1999, whether an SSI application has ever been made and payment status at 5 points in time, and dates of death as of spring 2001. For studies of health, the Medicare expenditure variables include inpatient hospital costs, outpatient hospital costs, home health care costs, and physicians' charges. The survey data cover functional capacity including ADLs and IADLs. For studies of work in retirement, the survey includes yearly information on extent of work, characteristics of the current or last job, and reasons for working or not working.

Purpose is to research the shape & influence of religion & spirituality in the lives of American youth; to identify effective practices in the religious, moral, and social formation of the lives of youth; to describe the extent & perceived effectiveness of the programs & opportunities that religious communities are offering to their youth; and to foster an informed national discussion about the influence of religion in youth's lives, in order to encourage sustained reflection about and rethinking of our cultural and institutional practices with regard to youth & religion.  The 2nd wave was designed to be a re-interview of all <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW1.asp\\'>Wave 1</a> youth survey respondents. Parents of the youth respondents were not re-interviewed. At the time of the 2nd survey, respondents were between the ages of 16-21. Conducted from June 9-November 24, 2005. <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW2.asp\\'>2nd wave</a> interviews were conducted only in English. Four youth respondents did not participate in the Wave 2 interview due to not being able to understand or speak English. Wave 2 covers many of the same topics as Wave 1. Many of the questions are identical. However, Wave 2 was re-designed to take into account changes in the lives of the respondents as they began to enter young adulthood. Wave 2 included new questions pertaining to behaviors occurring during the transition to adulthood, such as non-marital cohabitation, educational and career aspirations, pregnancy and marriage.  In <a href=\\'http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/NSYRW3.asp\\'>Wave 3</a> every attempt was made to re-interview all English-speaking Wave 1 youth survey respondents. At the time of the 3rd survey, respondents were between the ages of 18-24. Conducted from September 24, 2007-April 21, 2008.  Wave 3 replicated many of the questions asked in Waves 1 & 2 with some changes made to better capture the respondents' lives as they grew older. For example, there were fewer questions on parental monitoring and more on post-high school educational aspirations.","2011-06-17 16:59:08",,,,,,,"Series - ongoing"

To that end, a large and statistically representative sample of children born to foreign parents in Spain or those brought at an early age to the country was identified and interviewed in metropolitan Madrid and Barcelona. In total, almost 7,000 children of immigrants attending basic secondary school in close to 200 educational centers in both cities took part in the study.  The original survey was conducted in 2007-08; 4 years later, the same sample was traced and re-interviewed either at school, via telephone, or through contact in the social media. Through these means, the research team was able to identify and re-interview 73 percent of the original sample for which retrieval information was available. An additional replacement sample of over 1,500 second generation youths of the same average age as the original respondents was interviewed in the same schools in which the original study took place. Finally, and for comparative purposes, a sample of native-parentage Spanish youths was interviewed at the same time.  In total, over 7,000 cases were included in the 2nd phase of the study, representing the largest available longitudinal data set on the 2nd generation, not only in Spain but in all of Western Europe. The surveys cover all relevant aspects of adaptation and psycho-social development in late adolescence, including educational achievement and aspirations; labor market participation, occupation, and income; family structure and inter-generational relations; language knowledge, preferences, and use; friends' national origins and educational plans; national self-identification, self-esteem, and other psychological outcomes.  To supplement the information from immigrant children, the study also conducted a person-to-person survey of 25 percent of their parents.   They were interviewed in Spanish or in their native language.  The parental survey is representative of the earlier studies sample, including near identical proportions of all foreign nationalities present in the latter.","2016-05-10 10:35:19",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Enables an accurate picture of the social situation in the enlarged EU to be drawn, a picture that includes both objective and subjective elements. At the same time, it should be noted that there are some limitations to the data. While the sample sizes of around 1,000 per country provide a general population profile, they are too small to allow for detailed analysis of sub-groups, such as immigrants or single-parent families. Furthermore, although the wide range of topics covered by the survey is on the one hand a clear advantage, it also means that none of the topics could be treated in great depth. Some of the dimensions are measured with a narrower set of indicators than one would use in highly specialised surveys. However, the strength of the survey is that it provides a synthesis of information on the main aspects of quality of life, both objective and subjective.

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that these facets could be formed into Stace's 3-factor structure (i.e., Introvertive Mysticism, Extrovertive Mysticism, Interpretation).  These data contribute to the understanding of religious experience shared by practicing Buddhists, and lend strong support to the thesis that the phenomenology of mystical experience reveals a common experiential core that can be discerned across religious and spiritual traditions.

The main survey was designed to produce cross-sectional data, but the data on each individual have now been linked together to provide longitudinal information. The longitudinal data consist of 2 types of linked datasets, created using the weighting method to adjust for non-response bias. The <a href=\\'http://www.esds.ac.uk/search/indexSearch.asp?ct=xmlSn&q1=33315\\'>2-quarter datasets</a> link data from 2 consecutive waves, while the 5-quarter datasets link across a whole year (for example January 1999 to March 2000 inclusive) and contain data from all 5 waves. Linking together records to create a longitudinal dimension can, for example, provide information on gross flows over time between different labour force categories (employed, unemployed and economically inactive). This will provide detail about people who have moved between the categories. Also, longitudinal information is useful in monitoring the effects of government policies and can be used to follow the subsequent activities and circumstances of people affected by specific policy initiatives, and to compare them with other groups in the population. There are however methodological problems which could distort the data resulting from this longitudinal linking. The Office for National Statistics is continuing to research these problems and advises that the presentation of results should be carefully considered, and warnings should be included with outputs where necessary.

Automated searches of newspaper articles and congressional records were conducted of 1,000 key phrases addressing issues such as abortion, gun control, taxes, health care, war, the environment, immigration policy, stem cell research, and minorities. A new index of media slant was then constructed that measured the similarity of a news outlet's language to that of the congressional Republican or Democrat. To measure news slant, the researchers examined the set of all key phrases used by each congressperson and identified those used much more frequently by one political party than by another. Newspapers were then indexed by the extent to which the use of politically charged phrases in their news coverage resembled the use of the same phrases in the speech of a congressional Democrat or Republican. Part 1, Newspapers File, lists the slant index of 434 city newspapers across the United States and the total number of uses of key phrases for each newspaper. Part 2, News Counts File, indicates the number of news articles in each newspaper using each key phrase. Part 3, Congress File, lists the United States congressperson from each congressional district, his or her political party identification, the slant index, and the total number of uses of all key phrases for this congressperson.

The research team collected data on a total of 112 persons from 16 right-wing extremist (RWE) groups. In order to analyze the recruitment process, the principal investigator developed a new codebook that included a greater number of variables designed to measure different dimensions of the recruitment process. Some of the variables the investigator included were already in the American Terrorism Study dataset, however, the variable categories were revised. Other variables were included in light of prior terrorism studies and related scholarship such as research in the areas of social movements and new religious movements. The investigator also designed variables to measure the structural characteristics of the recruitment process.

This principle is reflected in the testing measures added to the original panel.

Also collected information about the racial and Hispanic-origin composition of patients; percent of patients with chronic conditions; percent of patients with a language barrier; use of interpreter services; sources of practice revenue; level and determinants of physician compensation; use of health information technology; physicians' perception of their ability to deliver care; effects of disease management programs and formal practice guidelines; extent of care coordination; malpractice concerns; and various other aspects of physicians' practice of medicine.","2016-05-10 16:18:42",,,,,,,"Single study"

1066,"Marital Instability Over the Life Course/Work and Family Life Study Series (1980+)","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00187","The intent of the data collection was to identify the causes of marital instability throughout the life course. Six waves of data were collected between 1980 and 2000 from married individuals between the ages of 18 and 55. In 1980 Wave I data focused primarily on female labor force participation in an effort to determine whether there was a relationship between wives' working outside of the home and marital dissolution or the likelihood of divorce. Wave II (1983) and Wave III (1988) employed a wider life-course perspective and studied the effects of factors such as economic resources, wives' employment, presence of children, marital satisfaction, life goals, health, and changes in any of these factors on actions intended to dissolve a marriage - including divorce and permanent separation and on marital relationships in general. Wave IV (1992, 1994) continued as the previous waves and provided additional data from adult offspring who were living in the household in 1980 and had reached age 19 by 1992. These additional respondents provided parallel measures with their parents regarding the quality of parent-child relationships, attitudes, and support along with exploring the impact of childhood experiences on the transition to adult life. Wave V (1997) examined the relationship between marital quality and stability and how it relates to changes in marital quality later in life. Additionally, Wave V includes a second adult offspring sample, along with a second interview of the adult offspring sample from Wave IV. Wave VI data were collected in 2000 and included the adult panel, a panel obtained from the offspring who participated in 1992 or 1997, a replication of the original cross-section study completed in 1980, and a comparison sample made up of persons who were married in 1980 and were between 39 and 75 years old. The investigators examined whether there were changes in marital quality between 1980 and 2000, identified factors that might have accounted for these changes, and sought to determine their impact on the health and longevity of older persons. In addition to Wave VI of the Marital Instability Over the Life Course Study (MIOLC), the Work and Family Life Study (WFLS) was conducted in 2000 and its primary aim is to assess changes in marital quality between 1980 and 2000. The WFLS also considers the effects of family-of-origin characteristics and marital history on the physical and psychological health of respondents. Included in the WFLS is a new cross-section sample using the same sampling procedures and interview questions that were used in the 1980 wave of the MIOLC. The Comparison Sample of the WFLS provides data to evaluate sample attrition, factors which lead to attrition, and attrition bias. (It should be noted that this comparison file is a special purpose sample and does not generalize to a normally defined population of ever married persons)","2010-05-10 12:29:09",,,,,,,"Series - ongoing"

The first wave of  (AJD1) provided a snapshot of the personal lives and careers of this cohort about 3 years after they began practicing law. The second wave (AJD2) sought to illuminate the progression of lawyers' careers through roughly 7 years in practice. The third wave (AJD3) continued to shed light on lawyers' 12-year professional and personal pathways. After 12 years, the AJD lawyers had a decade of work experience behind them, and the contours of their careers were more clearly shaped. Throughout their professional careers, these lawyers had experienced important transitions (such as promotion to partnership, marriage, and job changes), which were only in process by Wave 2. AJD3 marked a significant milestone, essential to assess the personal and career trajectories of this cohort of lawyers. AJD3 sought to locate and survey only individuals who had previously responded to either AJD1 or AJD2. Sample members who never responded to any survey wave were not located in AJD3. The AJD3 data collection started in May 2012 and was completed in early 2013. The dataset allowed for the analysis of a broad range of questions about the careers of lawyers and the social organization of the American legal profession. Topics covered include current professional employment, impact of economic downturn, type of work, clients, mentors, employment history, social, political, and community participation, and background and family information. Demographics include ethnicity, employment status, sexuality, marital status, age, and gender.","2014-12-01 08:57:44",,,,,,,"Series - ongoing"

People providing care in a professional capacity were excluded.   The main questionnaire then identified carers who also fitted the General Household Survey (GHS) definition of 'Carers', which excludes those caring as volunteers for a charity or organization, those caring for someone in an institution, those providing financial support only and those caring for someone with a temporary illness or disability, and asked a further range of questions.  The prevalence questionnaire covered household demographics and structure and aimed to identify carers eligible for the survey. The main questionnaire covered household information, whether respondent met the GHS definition of 'carer', support given to main person(s) cared for, support for carer, access to specific services for carers, impact of care-giving on carer, impact of care-giving on employment prospects and demographic details.

The project proposed that both of these features, which appear to be contradictory at the collective level, can arise from the process of social influence at the individual level. To explore this possibility empirically a website was constructed where participants could listen to, rate, and download new music.

These sites represent four census regions (Midwest, West, Northeast, and South), as well as urban and rural areas. Attempted to determine what effects alternative cost-sharing plans and a staff-model Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) had on the use of medical services and individual health outcomes. The main purpose was to assess how the cost of health services affected individuals' use of services, their satisfaction with health care, the quality of their care, and the state of their health. To study the effects of health insurance coverage, a comprehensive method for measuring health and monitoring changes in health over time was developed. Health status was seen as having 4 dimensions: physical, mental, social, and physiological. Physical health focused on 5 categories of activities: self-care, mobility, exertion, role fulfillment, and leisure pursuits. Mental health focused on mood and anxiety disorders along with loss of control over feelings, thoughts, and behavior. Social health was assessed by the frequency of several kinds of participation, interaction, and resources, covering family and home, social life, and community involvement. Physiologic health was determined by looking at a number of physical disorders both in adults (aged 14 to 61) and children (aged 0 to 13) that would be easily traced over time and would be responsive to changes in the level and quality of medical care. For adults, acne, congestive heart failure, and sleeping pill and tranquilizer use were considered. For children, variables included allergic conditions (asthma, eczema, hay fever), anemia, middle ear disease, hearing impairment, and vision impairment. Also included were general health measures based on single questions about health-related pain and worry, and a rating of health (excellent, good, fair, poor). Health habits described aspects of smoking, consumption of alcohol, weight, height, and exercise.","2016-05-10 16:04:41",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Surveyed couples 15 months after having applied and having been accepted into a BSF program at one of 8 locations offering services to unwed couples expecting, or having recently had a baby. The 1st major focus of the study was family structure. Question topics included information on recently born children, as well as the parents and their relationship status. If the parents were still together, respondents were asked whether they were currently married or planned to marry in the future. If no longer together, reasons for the relationship ending were explored. The 2nd major focus queried respondents about parental involvement with their child or children. They were then asked to rate their perceived quality as parents, their communication skills, and cooperation between parental responsibilities. Respondents were also questioned regarding the amount of time spent by each parent with their child, including playing games, feeding, and changing diapers. The 3rd major focus asked respondents about their relationships. They were asked to give their opinions of marriage and their level of satisfaction in their current relationship. Respondents were also asked to list the frequency, if applicable, of various occurrences within their relationship. Subjects included communication, enjoyment of each others' company, partner reliability, infidelity, and domestic violence. The 4th major focus queried respondents on their well-being. They were asked whether they attended religious services, how they felt in the past month about being a parent, and their feelings and behavior during the past week. Respondents were further asked if these feelings or problems made it difficult for them to work or communicate with other people. They were also asked about consumption of alcoholic beverages in the past year, and if alcohol use created problems with employment. The 5th major focus questioned respondents about the utilization of various services. They were asked if they participated in any programs such as classes, workshops, or group sessions in order to help their relationship. They were also asked if they had met with someone, such as a social worker or a priest, to help them work on their relationship. Respondents were asked if they participated in programs to improve parenting skills, learn job skills, increase education, or find employment. They were also asked if they participated in any programs to help with anger management or domestic violence. The 6th major focus dealt with paternity and child support. Respondents were asked if they voluntarily signed a birth certificate or document identifying them as the mother or father. They were asked if they were legally required to provide child support, the amount of that support, and if they gave money in addition to child support to help with the cost of raising the child or children. The 7th major focus dealt with family self-sufficiency. Respondents were asked if they or their partner performed any work for pay during the past year, the past month, and their earnings during those times. They were then asked if they received any additional sources of income such as welfare, disability insurance, and unemployment. Respondents were then asked if they and their partner combined some, all, or none of their money. They were asked how the responsibility for bill payment was divided between partners and if, at any point, they had difficulty paying bills. Respondents were also asked if they owned a car, rented or owned a home, and whether they were covered by health insurance. Lastly they were asked about their health and who they could count on in an emergency. The final major focus explored parental well-being. Respondents were asked if they were currently in prison or jail, had ever been arrested, had served a jail or prison sentence in the past and, if so, how long they were incarcerated. Additional information collected included country of origin of the respondent and the respondent's parents, who they spent most of their life with prior to age 18, whether they lived with both of their biological parents at the same time, and if their parents were married. Respondents were also asked about their previous sexual experience. Demographic data includes race, education level, age, income, and marital status.","2016-05-10 16:03:20",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

The cumulative trend questions concentrated on the respondents' knowledge and opinions of the European Community (EC)/European Union (EU). Respondents were asked for their opinion regarding European unification and whether or not they were satisfied with the speed of regional integration. Respondents were also asked to describe their sentiments with respect to citizenship and whether they identified themselves more as a citizen of their home country or as a citizen of Europe. Also asked questions regarding EC/EU institutions such as the European Parliament (EP), the European Commission, the European Court of Justice, and the European Central Bank, among others. Respondents were asked whether they had heard about EC/EU institutions, the importance of these institutions, and whether or not they believed these institutions to be trustworthy.

The older LSAY cohort, Cohort One, consisted of a national sample of 2,829 tenth-grade students in public high schools throughout the United States. These students were followed for an initial period of 7 years, ending 4 years after high school in 1994. Cohort Two, consisted of a national sample of 3,116 seventh-grade students in public schools that served as feeder schools to the same high schools in which the older cohort was enrolled. These students were followed for an initial period of 7 years, concluding with a telephone interview approximately one year after the end of high school in 1994.  Beginning in the fall of 1987, the LSAY collected a wide array of information from each student, including: (1) a science achievement test and a mathematics achievement test each fall, (2) an attitudinal and experience questionnaire at the beginning and end of each school year, (3) reports about education and experience from all science and math teachers in each school, (4) reports on classroom practice by each science and math teacher serving an LSAY student, (5) an annual 25-minute telephone interview with one parent of each student, and (6) extensive school-level information from the principal of each study school.  In 2006, the NSF funded a proposal to re-contact the original LSAY students (now in their mid-30's) to resume data collection to determine their educational and occupational outcomes. Through an extensive tracking activity, more than 95 % of the original sample of 5,945 LSAY students were located or accounted for.

For many years, the Census Bureau has estimated a number of experimental poverty measures based on recommendations of the 1995 NAS report (NAS-based measures).  An Interagency Technical Working Group on Developing a Supplemental Poverty Measure was formed in 2009 and charged with developing a set of initial starting points to permit the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to produce a Supplemental Poverty Measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure will not replace the official poverty measure and will not be used to determine eligibility for government programs.

Over the 5-year study period, the treatment and control students responded to 7 self-administered surveys: (1) at baseline in the 7th grade, (2) post-intervention in the 7th grade, (3) in the 8th grade, (4) pre-intervention in the 9th grade, (5) post intervention in the 9th grade, (6) in the 10th grade, and (7) in the 11th grade. Topics covered by the surveys include normative beliefs, social skills, attitudes toward drug use, and self-reported use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other illicit drugs. Also include measures of implementation fidelity of the 7th grade TCYL curriculum from trained observers who rated the D.A.R.E. officers' delivery in the classroom. The fidelity measures encompass content coverage and instructional strategy.","2011-11-29 16:56:07",,,,,,,"Single study"

1388,"Justice of Land in a Land of Injustice, 2004","http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30102.v1","Examined the lingering effects of Apartheid, with a focus on land distribution. Respondents were asked about their media usage, their interest in politics, whether they discussed politics with others, the general economic situation in South Africa, and their family's standard of living. They were then asked about their relationships with other people, including whether they got along with those with differing opinions, viewpoints, and values. Respondents were also asked about property rights. Questions included whether the land rights of the wealthy should be reduced, if community rights were more important than individual rights, if only property owners should be allowed to vote, if people had a right to land they had lived on for a long time despite not owning it, whether people should receive compensation if their land should be taken away for land reform, the possible consequences of taking away land rights, if land should be taken away from certain groups only, or whether all land right claims should be denied. Respondents were queried about civil rights and freedoms. Questions included how important rights such as free speech, the right to protest, and the right to land ownership were to them. They were also asked whether it was acceptable for the police to search houses without permission in order to fight crime and if sometimes it would be necessary to ignore the law to solve problems. Respondents were then asked to list the groups they do and do not identify with, and how they felt about being a member of a group. They were asked to self-categorize into groups and then queried about their interactions and relations with other groups. They were asked how much contact they had with other groups and how many of their \\'true\\' friends were members of different groups. Respondents were also asked how well they understood the customs of other groups, if they were uncomfortable being around or sharing the same political party with a group, and if South Africa would be better off if other groups were not present. Next, respondents were asked about Apartheid. Questions included how many Black people were harmed by Apartheid, if large companies both inside and outside of South Africa were to blame for the harm done, and whether these companies should be forced to pay for the harm they caused under Apartheid. Additionally, they were queried about their life under Apartheid compared to their current life, including past experiences such as having to use a pass to move around, and being assaulted by the police. Respondents were also asked about their knowledge of government organizations including the South African Constitutional Court and Parliament, and their satisfaction with these organizations. They were then asked how important certain issues were to them such as drugs, unemployment, and racial reconciliation. Additionally, they were asked about the election of leaders, and whether multi-party elections were effective ways to choose those leaders. Respondents were also asked about the goods they owned and their financial assets. The survey also included several vignettes with scenarios of land disputes, which were read to the respondents. They were then asked their opinions of the possible outcomes of these vignettes. Demographic information included age, year of birth, highest education level completed, language spoken mostly at home, attendance at places of religious worship, religion, employment status, household composition, how long they have lived in their current community, whether that community had a Traditional Leader, ownership of goods, membership in organizations, whether someone close has died of AIDS, has AIDS, or are HIV positive, and province, size, and metropolitan area of residence.

Archival data on each states' HSEE policy was collected in order to (1) test hypotheses about the factors that have lead to the diffusion of state HSEEs over time and across states, and (2) test hypotheses about the impact of state HSEEs on student academic achievement and high school graduation rates. These variables were derived from a variety of primary source materials, including public records, legal archival resources, newspaper reports, and communications with officials in state education agencies. In order to make these materials available to future users, a separate linked data file was created that (1) provides a full bibliographic reference for each piece of source material, (2) gives the three-digit unique identifier that is associated with it, and (3) provides the name of the file that houses the actual document.

1406,"How Downsizing the Russian Military Affects Officers and Their Wives (1995-1997, Russian Federation)","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30542","Examined the effects of the downsizing of the Russian military. Conducted in 2 waves. The 1st wave queried officers who were scheduled to be released from service within 6 months, officers who were not scheduled to be released, and the wives of the officers. The 2nd wave of interviews followed-up with the initial respondents approximately 18 months later. The groups in the 2nd wave consisted of either current or former servicemen and their wives. A major focus of the study was employment. During the first wave, officers and their wives were queried on their current employment status, whether they were satisfied with their salary, the level of skill required in their work, and their supervisor's management style. Additionally, wives were asked if their job interfered with aspects of their lives, while servicemen were asked about their army careers. Questions included how long they had served in the military, whether they were active participants in war, how loyal they felt toward the army, whether or not they planned on leaving, and what reasons were behind any plans to leave. Servicemen were asked about their level of education, whether they had completed any additional school or training courses, and if they had any civilian job experience. They were also asked what important aspects they desired in a new job, and how confident they were that they would find employment that met those desires. A 2nd major focus was living conditions. Questions included how much food allowance they were provided by the army, how many times they and their family had moved as a requirement of their career, which services and resources they had access in their present location, the effect retirement would have on them personally as well as on their families, and what government assistance would be provided upon retirement. They were further queried about whether they currently had enough money for necessities and if their housing was provided by the army. A 3rd major focus of the study was health. Respondents were questioned about their experience with health concerns (headaches, anxiety, etc.) and the frequency of occurrence. They were asked if they or their families had experienced significant events in the past year such as the death of a child, or the loss of their home due to natural disaster. They were also asked if they drank alcohol, the amount they consumed, and whether they or anyone close to them felt they had a problem with alcohol abuse. They were also asked whether or not they smoked, and if so, how much. A 4th major focus was social relationships and behaviors. Questions included their relationship with their spouse and their family, whether they had a confidante, in whom they confided. They were asked if they got together with neighbors, attended religious services and, if so, how often they participated in these events. A 5th major focus was the respondents' opinions about the downsizing of the military. They were asked if the assistance being offered was sufficient, whether the reimbursement package provided was adequate, and how they felt others were being affected by the downsizing. Respondents were also queried as to whom they felt deserved the blame for the downsizing of the military. During the 2nd wave, respondents were contacted for follow-up interviews. In addition to the questions previously asked during the first wave, respondents were asked if their spouse had changed, whether their family remained the same size, and about their employment status as compared to one year prior. Former servicemen were asked if they had new employment and how they acquired their new job. If unemployed, respondents were asked if they intended to find new work and, if not, what their reasons were for not seeking employment. If seeking employment, they were asked what type of job they would like, and how confident they were that they would be able to find work. Additionally, former servicemen were asked to compare life as a civilian to their life of army service in various areas. They were also asked about life at home, their relationship with their wives, who was responsible for the key decisions in the household, and the percentage of housework they do. They were also queried about whether the work of their wives interfered with family responsibilities. If applicable, wives were asked how they were affected by their husband's discharge from the military. They were further queried whether household disagreements, child care difficulties, and problems with marital relations had arisen due to the workload of their husband at a new place of employment. They were asked about the level of help the families of servicemen needed from the government, as well as their attitude toward their husband's military service career. Demographic questions included marital status, religious beliefs, affiliation with a particular church, ethnicity, and monthly income.","2016-05-10 15:56:09",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

This information is complemented by a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. Uses 4 modules to collect information on the health care, education, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. These 4 modules are not always collected each year. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathers important information about the youth the services are directed toward and how the services are provided. The census indicates the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examines prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility.

Using qualitative and quantitative data, it explored the character, organisation and operation of the poor law in Ireland. Combined macro and micro analysis to compile a picture of poor relief that moved from the national perspective, through the regional, to the local. Annual published returns of poor law statistics were used to identify national, regional and local trends in the provision and utilisation of relief, revealing the existence of what appear to be distinct welfare regimes with both regional and ideological characteristics. Case studies of 12 poor law unions throughout the country were then undertaken utilising the administrative records of the poor law boards in order to explore the influence of factors such as religion, politics and regional economics on the scope and character of relief practices. By analysing both general trends in relief policy and practice, and the micro-politics of relief, the project has produced new insights into the understanding and experience of poverty in post-Famine Ireland and the evolution of welfare systems.

The native grid cell resolution is 2.5 arc-minutes, or ~5km at the equator, although aggregates at coarser resolutions are also provided. Separate grids are available for population count and density per grid cell.  Population data estimates are provided for 1990, 1995, and 2000, and projected to 2005, 2010, and 2015. The projected grids were produced in collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Programme (FAO) as Population Count and Density Grid Future Estimates. There is also an extensive map collection that includes population density and sub-national administrative boundary maps (depicting the input units) at country, continental, and global levels. Summary information on the size and number of input unit and sources is available in an Excel spreadsheet.<br>  Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version One (GRUMPv1) builds on GPW to construct a common geo-referenced framework of urban and rural areas by combining census data with satellite data. GRUMPv1 comprises 3 data products. First, GRUMPv1 provides a higher resolution gridded population data product at 30 arc-seconds, or ~1km at the equator, for 1990, 1995, and 2000. Second, GRUMPv1's urban extents data set delineates urban areas based on NOAA's night-time lights data set and buffered settlement centroids (where night lights are not sufficiently bright). Third, GRUMPv1 provides a points data set of all urban areas with populations of greater than 1,000 persons, which may be downloaded in Excel, CSV, and shapefile formats. As with GPW, there is an extensive map collection depicting the data sets at country, continental, and global levels.","2016-08-08 17:49:14",,,,,,,"Data archive or collection"

Through study of peers' voting records, and particularly of government defeats in the chamber, the project assessed the impact of the 2nd chamber on policy. Also investigated changing behavior within the party and Crossbench groups.

For people who lived in a different residence, the location of their previous residence is collected.  ACS uses a series of monthly samples to produce estimates. Estimates for geographies of population 65,000 or greater are published annually using these monthly samples. Three years of monthly samples are needed to publish estimates for geographies of 20,000 or greater and 5 years for smaller geographies.

The goal was to identify and rigorously test a diverse set of innovative models designed to promote employment stability and wage or earnings progression among current or former welfare recipients or other low-income groups. As part of ERA, over a dozen different program models have been evaluated over the past 10 years using random assignment research designs. These models embodied states' and localities' choices of program goals, target populations, and program features, and the programs were largely paid for through existing funding streams. The programs were thus \\'real-world\\' interventions initiated by practitioners and not programs set up and funded solely for research purposes. The diversity of the models presents an opportunity to explore the effectiveness of a variety of strategies implemented for different populations in order to identify what might work. This collection includes 7 datasets, four classified as Core/Final Report Sites and three from Harder to Employ Sites. Almost all of the ERA programs targeted current or former recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the cash welfare program that mainly serves single mothers and their children. The programs differed, however, in terms of when services were first provided and to whom. The Harder to Employ Sites files focus on the 3 ERA models that served harder to employ populations; (1) Tier 2 program in Minnesota: unemployed welfare-to-work participants who were in welfare-to-work services for a year or longer and hadn't been employed in the previous three months were given welfare-to-work services aimed at addressing barriers to employment which took into account their employment limitations. The Tier 2 program focused on assessing barriers to employment and addressing those barriers through referrals to appropriate services and close monitoring and follow-up. (2) New York City PRIDE: welfare recipients who were deemed \\'employable with limitations\\' were required to take part in welfare-to-work activities -- which emphasized unpaid work experience, education, and job placement assistance -- however, the program took into account their employment limitations when placing them in activities. The PRIDE program began with an in-depth assessment of participants' work and education history and their medical conditions. (3) New York City Substance Abuse Case Management (SACM): public assistance applicants and recipients who screened positive for signs of substance abuse were given a mandatory appointment to assess the level of substance abuse treatment needed. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, clients were referred to treatment, employment services, or a combination of both. Noncompliance at any stage resulted in sanctions and loss of public assistance benefits. Information was collected on respondents' employment status, job training, pay rate and benefits, occupation sector, health care, childcare, transportation, and a variety of job related topics. Demographic variables included household income, housing arrangements, number of people living in household, and respondent health status.","2016-05-10 15:40:43",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Goals were to evaluate the effects of the Minnesota Youth Tobacco Prevention Initiative and its shutdown on youth smoking patterns, and to better define the patterns of development of tobacco use in adolescents. A multilevel sample was constructed representing individuals, local jurisdictions and the entire state, and data were collected to characterize each of these levels. Major topics covered by the survey are cigarette use, nicotine dependence, alcohol use and dependence, cigarette access, quitting smoking, use of other tobacco products and marijuana, parent smoking habits, tobacco marketing, emotions and stress perceptions, and perceptions and opinions of smoke-free laws, tobacco companies, and tobacco age restrictions.

The research investigates the extent to which changes in the community produce changes in family formation behavior, and whether the family organization of individual life courses produces these changes in behavior. Used a combination of ethnographic and survey research methods to gather 171 neighborhood histories, 142 school histories, 118 health service histories, 20 bus route histories, household farming practices, family planning histories, and household composition in Western Chitwan, Nepal. Personal histories were gathered from the 5,271 individuals ages 15-59 years living in these neighborhoods using a semi-structured Life History Calendar and a highly structured survey questionnaire. The sample neighborhoods for this study were chosen to represent the five major ethnic groups inhabiting the area: high caste Hindus, hill Tibeto-Burmese (such as Gurung, Tamang, and Magar), indigenous terai Tibeto-Burmese (such as Tharu, Darai, and Kumal), Newar, and other caste Hindus. Neighborhood history calendars measured the neighborhood's distance, in terms of minutes walking, to a variety of organizations and services. Schools were defined as places of instruction for children of any age or grade. Health clinics were defined as any places of care and healing, such as doctors' offices, hospitals, and health posts. Employers were any places that employed 10 or more people for pay. Cinemas were movie theaters or halls where movies were shown. Bus stops were any places where people could obtain a ride for pay on a vehicle.  This particular study spanned 1997-2002. These data were combined with data from the Chitwan Valley Family Study 1996-1997, and the Household Agriculture and Consumption Survey 1996.","2016-07-14 14:22:31",,,,,,,"Single study"

Addressed the real-life economic, social and health challenges young people encounter on a daily basis. The educational programme developed for the intervention was accredited by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA, the national government body that accredits education and training curricula) meaning that not only will young people who complete the program have received valuable skills, but that they have documentation of these skills that can be used in future job searches. Siyakha Nentsha was delivered in secondary schools during school hours. It was led by young adult mentors who were chosen from the local community and received extensive training. Sessions with students occurred 2-3 times per week and each was approximately 1 hour in length. The long-term objective of the programme is to improve lifelong functional capabilities and well-being of adolescent females and males who face high risks for HIV, teenage pregnancy, school dropout, and unemployment, coupled with the actual or potential loss of one or both parents. The skills are geared to help offer protective strategies against HIV and mechanisms for coping with and mitigating the impacts of AIDS, with the long-term goal of building economic, social and health assets. The study has 3 intervention arms: control, partial intervention and full intervention. These arms were randomized at the classroom level for 10th and 11th graders in Round 1 in 7 secondary schools. One school that received a delayed intervention served as the control sample. The 2 versions of the intervention differ in that the full version includes HIV/AIDS education, social capital building, and financial capabilities, whereas the partial version omits the financial capabilities component.

The goal was to provide in-depth life history on the drug use trajectories of older drug users, specific turning points in drug use patterns, and drug-related health risks over a person's life course.  Two questionnaires were used to collect the quantitative data. The 1st questionnaire asked about the person's basic demographic information (gender, race, age, and education), health history (has the person been diagnosed with HIV, AIDS, or Hepatitis C), and drug use (route and frequency) and treatment in the past 30 days across ten different substances (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens/LSD/Ecstasy/club drugs, prescription pills, cocaine, crack, heroin, amphetamines, and methamphetamine).  A 2nd questionnaire was used to serve as a retrospective life history of the person. The questionnaire asked about the same drug use and treatment of the same 10 drugs but this time looking at the entire year.

1550,"Chicago Male Drug Use and Health Survey (MSM Supplement), 2002-2003","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/34303","In recent years, club drugs such as MDMA, Ketamine, GHB, and Rohypnol have emerged as major drugs of abuse. The national and local Chicago news media have publicized law enforcement actions and adverse health outcomes, including fatalities, related to the abuse of these substances. Media accounts and a limited body of research have identified use of these substances as prevalent in the gay male community. This prevalence coincides with recent increases in HIV seropositive incidence. There is a clear need for a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of club drug use in the general population, and particularly in the subgroup of sexually active gay men. Noting these research gaps and their considerable adverse public health implications, this supplemental study was designed to apply an expanded protocol developed from an earlier study conducted (Feasibility and Use of Biological Measurement in Drug Surveys; R01DA12425, SRL Study #860) to a sample of gay men in Chicago. This study evaluated whether findings regarding the feasibility and use of drug testing in drug surveys derived from general population samples are generalizable to a probability sample of 216 gay men in the city of Chicago. For this project, a supplemental module was added to the main study survey that asked detailed questions about involvement in the gay community, risky sexual activity and HIV seropositivity. The scope of biological measurement was also expanded to incorporate testing for Rohypnol and Ketamine in hair (MDMA was already being tested as part of the general sample hair screen).","2016-05-10 15:18:43",,,,,,,"Single study"

The data collection efforts included a baseline survey of the Trenton community conducted in 2002 and surveys of Trenton child care providers conducted in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In addition, births records for Trenton, Camden, and Newark were obtained from the New Jersey State Department of Health. The data from the 2002 community survey represents a baseline picture of the primary caregivers of children ages 0-5 in Trenton on a set of outcomes, among them parenting behaviors and strategies that the initiative hoped to influence.  Like the baseline community survey, the follow-up surveys interviewed the primary caregivers of children aged 0-5 in Trenton households about child and parental health, parenting practices, fathers' involvement in their children's lives, health insurance and health care utilization, attendance at parenting groups or classes, and utilization of child care. In addition, the surveys collected information on country of birth, year of immigration, race, Hispanic origin, education, employment status, alcohol use, earnings, and household income.  The community surveys followed a repeated cross-sectional design. That is, individual community residents were not followed over time; rather, at each wave of data collection, a new sample of respondents were interviewed.

Designed to evaluate a variety of innovative ways to boost employment, reduce welfare receipt, and promote well-being in low-income populations. Evaluated the effectiveness of the Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), which is an employment program for former prisoners based in New York City. The CEO evaluation aimed to determine whether CEO's transitional jobs and other services are more effective than basic job search assistance. Enrollment for this study was conducted between January 2004 and October 2005 and resulted in a sample of 977 former prisoners (568 in the program group and 409 in the control group). Individuals assigned to the program group were eligible for all of CEO's services, including the pre-employment class, the transitional job, job coaching, job development, a fatherhood program, and post-placement services. Individuals assigned to the control group began with a shorter version of the pre-employment class and were given access to a resource room with basic job search equipment such as computers and fax machines. Respondents were asked about their employment history, recidivism history, time spent on parole, parole violations, and arrest history, including prior convictions, types of convictions, and length of incarceration. Information was collected about respondents' work experience with and without the assistance of the CEO; this information included whether respondents participated in group or individual job searches, vocational or educational training, received referrals to job openings, help with their resumes, advice about filing out job applications, job interviews, or how to behave on the job, help with child support issues and whether they participated in father discussion groups or parenting programs. Respondents were also asked about their current living situation, work schedule, hourly wage, job benefits, health coverage, whether they had a mentor, how often they saw their children, and the type of relationship they had with their children.

First comprehensive attempt to understand the diverse low-income population and to test interventions aimed at the most common barriers to this population's employment. The HtE demonstration was designed to evaluate a variety of innovative ways to boost employment, reduce welfare receipt, and promote well-being in low-income populations. This study tests two employment strategies. The first employment strategy, administered by the Transitional Work Corporation (TWC), was a paid transitional employment program that combined temporary, subsidized employment with work-related assistance. The second employment strategy, the Success Through Employment Preparation (STEP) program, focused on assessing and treating employment barriers before participants obtained a job. From 2004 to 2006, 1,942 recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) who were not currently employed or participating in work activities were randomly assigned to one of the two program groups. Evaluation of the programs had three components: implementation and process analysis, impact analysis, and cost analysis. The implementation and process analysis examined how the programs operated, based primarily on site visits and interviews with program staff and administrators. The impact analysis measured the programs' effects on outcomes including employment, welfare use, and family functioning. The cost analysis compares the financial costs of the interventions. Outcomes for both groups were followed for at least three years, using public administrative records and surveys of study participants. In addition, follow-up surveys were conducted 15 and 36 months after random assignment in most sites. Information was collected on whether respondents participated in employment, vocational or education training activity. Respondents were asked whether they received help for things such as childcare, getting and/or keeping Medicaid and food stamps, paying for transportation, substance abuse treatment, addressing domestic violence, addressing legal issues, financial needs, or handling their household budget. Respondents were also asked if they received paid vacation time or sick days, where their income came from, and whether they earned any type of degree or certificate. Additional topics include health status, the length of time respondents received TANF funds, and employment history. Demographic information includes age, race, marital status, education, employment status, and home ownership status.","2016-05-10 15:09:59",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

The experiment provided informal firms incentives to formalize. A sample of informal firms with one to 14 paid employees in two largest Sri Lanka cities were divided into four treatment groups and a control group. The first treatment group was given information about the costs and benefits of, and procedures for, registering their firm for tax purposes, and offered reimbursement for the cost of registering, about 1000 Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR).

First comprehensive attempt to understand the diverse low-income population and to test interventions aimed at the most common barriers to this population's employment. The HtE demonstration was designed to assess ways to boost employment, reduce welfare receipt, and promote well-being in low-income populations. Analyzed the effectiveness of the Rhode Island \\'Working toward Wellness\\' (WTW) program, a one-year program that provided telephonic care management to depressed parents receiving Medicaid in Rhode Island. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (QIDS-SR) questionnaire was administered to parents in order to identify those with major depression. All consenting parents who were found to have major depression were then assigned to the study. The Working Toward Wellness full research sample consisted of 499 individuals randomly assigned between November 2004 and October 2006 (245 members in the program group and 254 in the control group). The research team followed the two groups for three years using surveys. All 400 sample members completed a baseline survey at random assignment, providing basic demographic information, data on depression, other health outcomes, employment, participation in outreach programs, receipt of behavioral health services, and material hardship prior to enrollment in the study. Three follow up surveys were collected at the sixth month, eighteenth month, and thirty-sixth month marks. The WTW 6, 18, and 36 month reports include data from surveys administered to parents and children; however, only measures used in the adult/parent analysis are included due to restrictions. Care managers recorded information on attempted and completed calls with 230 members in the program group. Data was collected on respondent's general health, depression scores and treatments, substance abuse, work performance and attendance, as well as wages and income. Demographic information includes age, race, marital status, education, employment status, individual and household monthly income, as well as social security and disability status.","2016-05-10 15:02:49",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

The overall research questions of this study include: (1) how demographic and socioeconomic processes at the household level, e.g. those related to family structures and livelihood systems, affect local residents' resource exploitation patterns and land use practices; (2) how local residents respond to shifts in government policy, especially the implementation of two nationwide conservation programs, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), in WNR; and (3) how household and policy dynamics interact to affect the natural environment of WNR. Example hypotheses tested in this study concerned: (1) the effects of conservation policies on local households' energy consumption patterns and fuelwood collection behaviors; (2) the connection between a household's demographic and socioeconomic background and its responses to conservation policies; (3) the relationships between social networks and labor migration; (4) the factors that affect a household's participation in nature-based tourism and the distribution of tourism benefits among different households; and (5) the potential implication of the processes described above on wildlife habitat change and conservation. The data collection in this study focuses on household demographics, household income and expenditure, fuelwood and electricity use, as well as the development of non-agricultural activities such as migration and tourism. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect yearly data of the previous year in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010 using highly structured survey questionnaires.

To be on-schedule during the 1995-1996 school year, Project STAR students would be high school sophomores (10th Grade). The researchers reviewed the Tennessee Competency Examination (TCE) data for the 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96 school years. Schools begin administering the TCE to students in eighth grade and they are required to pass the TCE prior to graduating from high school.

At each wave, a screener questionnaire is administered to the sample which divides the sample into three parts: the non-disabled (frequently called screen-outs), the disabled but living in the community, and the disabled living in an institution. About 5,000 people die between waves and are replaced by a sample of about that size of people who have become age 65 since the prior wave. Because of budget considerations it usually has not been possible to continue the entire non-disabled sample into the next wave. Instead a sample of the non-disabled is drawn to keep the total sample size for a wave at about 20,000. One of the interesting and useful features of the NLTCS is that data are collected on help that the sample person receives from informal caregivers.","2016-05-10 15:02:13",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in 5 cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1. The low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location.  2. The traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling.  3. The control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of \\'neighborhood\\' on participating families.","2016-05-10 15:00:10",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Several features from each case of digital activism were documented, including the year and month that online action commenced, the estimated age and country of origin of the initiator(s), the geographic scope of their campaign, and whether the action was online only, or also featured offline activities. Researchers were interested in the number and types of software applications that were used by digital activists. Specifically, information was collected on whether software applications were used to circumvent censorship or evade government surveillance, to transfer money or resources, to aid in co-creation by a collaborative group, or for purposes of networking, mobilization, information sharing, or technical violence (destructive/disruptive hacking). The collection illustrates the overall focus of each case of digital activism by defining the cause advanced or defended by the action, the initiator's diagnosis of the problem and its perceived origin, the identification of the targeted audience that the campaign sought to mobilize, as well as the target whose actions the initiators aimed to influence. Finally, each case of digital activism was evaluated in terms of its success or failure in achieving the initiator's objectives, and whether any other positive outcomes were apparent.","2016-05-10 14:57:00",,,,,,,"Single study"

1704,"Land Use, Agropastoral Production, Family Composition, and Household Economy in Santarem, Para, Brazil, June-August 2003 (ICPSR 34347)","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34347/","Consists of 8 interconnected datasets and 1 linking file. The primary unit of analysis is the rural property or lot. Each lot in the sample contains a minimum of 1 household with a mean of 1.33 households per lot in the final sample. Within households, data were collected on subsets of individuals as well as additional properties used by the households in the study. These 2003 Santarem data come from interviews with farm families in an agricultural zone south of the city of Santarem in the Brazilian state of Para. The study region is adjacent to the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers and the northern terminus of the BR-163 (the Cuiaba-Santarem Highway). BR-163 links intensive agropastoral production (particularly mechanized soybean farming) in the state of Mato Grosso to Santarem, where the multinational corporation Cargill runs a deepwater port (opened in 2003) for loading soybeans onto oceangoing ships. The opening of this port has accelerated the process of urbanization and led to a transformation from a landscape of small family farming to a landscape of mechanized agriculture. The discourse on deforestation has focused on the alarming rates of deforestation in the Amazon Basin to the neglect of the dynamic and reciprocal influences between the human population and the environment.  This study investigated 5 basic questions: (1) Does the changing availability of household labor over the household life cycle affect the trajectory of deforestation and land use change in the same way for later generations of Amazonian farmers as for first generation in-migrants? (2) What are the determinants of changing household labor supply? Specifically, what are the biophysical and socioeconomic determinants of entries into and exits from the household through fertility, migration, and marriage? (3) How are the decisions of households regarding land use and labor allocation constrained by soil quality, access to water supplies, interannual drought events (e.g. El Nino type events), and other resource scarcities? (4) Are there notable differences in land use choices made by landholders who live in an urban area (away from the piece of land owned in the rural area) in contrast to the decisions made by those who live on their rural properties? (5) What are the bases for the precipitous decline in female fertility in these frontier regions, especially the use of sterilization after two pregnancies? Households will be surveyed in the Santarem region, in the Lower Tapajos Basin, Brazilian Amazon to collect detailed demographic, land-use histories, and economic data. The sampling of households for inclusion in the study will be based on a stratified random sample by period of occupation in Santarem, to capture intergenerational processes that preceded the availability of satellite images. Based on the particular combination of methodologies used in this investigation (traditional household surveys, satellite image analysis, and GIS, and the scaling up and down from households to landscape), future environmental changes were projected for the regional landscape under various scenarios of continued settlement, household life cycles, combinations of credit, and changing environmental conditions.","2016-05-10 14:56:42",,,,,,,"Single study"

The theoretical framework of the study was cultural epidemiology, which combines quantitative and qualitative measures to study experience, meaning, and behavior in subpopulations of interest. The study design enabled important comparisons across national settings that highlight the differential effects of political-economic context, differences in stigma dynamics for active disease compared to latent infection, and measured the impact of stigma on adherence to preventive therapy. Study components included an ethnography of TB stigma, a cross-cultural epidemiologic study, and a community trial of adherence to preventive therapy. Study sites were South Florida, United States, and Leogane, Haiti. The study aimed to investigate: (1) differences in the degree and components of stigma across different sociocultural settings and comparison groups (community members, health care providers, patients); (2) differential stigma effects in a public vs. private, culturally competent clinic; (3) correlates of TB-related stigma; and (4) the influence of perceived stigma on adherence to latent tuberculosis therapy. Data were collected between 2003-2006 in three phases: Phase I Ethnographic Research; Phase II Cultural Epidemiologic Study; and Phase III Adherence Study. A total of 768 persons were interviewed, including 408 women (53 percent) and 360 men (47 percent). All study aims were completed with the exception of No. 2, which was not possible due to the closure of the Haitian Community Clinic in South Florida. The study consists of data from community, patient, and provider interviews. Demographic variables include sex, age, primary language, education level, employment status, marital status, and religion.","2016-05-10 14:52:46",,,,,,,"Single study"

Very little is currently known about how eating patterns and migration affect the health, nutritional status and experiences of ageing among Bangladeshi women. This information is needed to inform the development of culturally sensitive and effective programs to improve the health of this socially disadvantaged group.  The aim of this study is to closely examine migration, nutrition, and ageing across 2 generations of Bangladeshi women living in Cardiff, UK and in Bangladesh. Mixed methods will be used to assess body weight, bone density, general health status, and women's perceptions of nutrition, eating patterns, and ageing. Results will inform the development of community-based, participant-driven resources for promoting nutrition and healthy ageing.    The overarching goal is to develop rich multimedia resources that enable presentation of the findings to the general public, academia, and Bangladeshi community members, and to assist health practitioners working with Bangladeshi communities. Engagement with policy makers is also planned to inform policy development to improve the health status of ageing Bangladeshi adults.

1885,"Cornell Study of Occupational Retirement, 1952","http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/34918","National, longitudinal study of retirement that began in 1952 and was likely the 1st large-scale study of retirement behavior. Aimed to understand and follow the transition from work to retirement -- a \\'well-defined\\' life transition in the 1950s. Followed a cohort of 64-year-old workers into their retirement years. Over the course of the 6-year study, over 50 percent of the respondents retired. Includes a wide range of questions regarding: sociodemographic characteristics, family, daily activities, work (type of work and work satisfaction), economic status (income, homeownership, and household size), pensions, age identity, age stereotypes, retirement plans, health, life satisfaction and adjustment to the retirement transition.  Unique features of the study include: (1) Gender. Both men and women were surveyed. Much of our current understanding of retirement behavior mid-century (and even into the 1970s) is based on men's experiences. The Cornell Study includes female workers, both unmarried and married. (2) Longitudinal Design. Most retirement studies at that point in history were small-scale and cross-sectional. (3) Health Information. In addition to self-reported health information from the respondents, medical directors at the sampled companies were interviewed and asked to conduct a standardized physical examination of the employees in the sample -- the medical records on the respondents have been retained. These data are in hard-copy paper format. Thus, it appears that no meaningful analysis of the data has yet been conducted.   This study consists of data from the first wave of the project, conducted in 1952. As the baseline for the ongoing longitudinal research, it provides useful information on potential retirees' attitudes and corresponding demographic information.","2016-05-10 14:33:05",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

The survey was conducted in three waves from May to June 2010 with a large-scale panel of 600 respondents who represented the five regions' gender, age, and education proportions. The study analyzed factors that influence the formation and change of voter preferences through three broad theoretical frameworks: (1) The sociological model that explains voter preference as a reflection of major social fragmentation (education, gender, income, religion, region, etc.); (2) The psychological model of the Michigan School that explains voter preference formation and change as activation of party identification in United States or Western elections, and regional identification in Korea as a proxy; (3) The rational voter model that posits that individuals, after calculating their own interests, support candidates or parties that possess the policies and ideology to maximize those interests. The South Korean Election Panel studies utilize \\'tracking core questions\\': questions that repeatedly track the change in vote determinants. These questions focus on attitudes on candidate factors, political party factors, election campaigns, issues, and policies. In this study, respondents were asked about the local election, their voting behavior, attitudes about political parties, which candidate they voted for in the 2006, 2007, and 2008 elections, exposure to media, major issues in the country, and the Lee Myung-bak administration. Economic questions asked about the living conditions of the respondent's residing city, how this compared to other cities, the respondent's household condition, and the economic situation of the country. Questions were also asked about the performance of President Lee Myung-bak and the respondent's local Governor/Mayor.

Builds on 2 previous studies of the workforce, <a href=\\'http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=2798\\'>Social Change and Economic Life Initiative Surveys, 1986-1987</a> and <a href=\\'http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=5368\\'>Employment in Britain, 1992</a>. The first Skills Survey was conducted in 1997 and represented a new approach to assessing the extent to which those at work in Britain had skills matching the requirements of their jobs. The 2001 survey was aimed at assessing how much had changed between the two surveys. The 3rd survey in 2006 enhanced this time series data further but had the overarching aim of providing a resource for analysing skill and job requirements in the British economy in the middle part of the current decade. The Skills and Employment Survey, 2012 (SES2012) was the 4th in the series, and aimed to again add to the time series data and, coinciding as it did with a period of economic recession, aimed to provide insight into whether the British workforce felt under additional pressure/demand from employers as a result of redundancies and cut backs.  Although these surveys were not originally planned as part of a series and had different funding sources and objectives, continuity in questionnaire design has meant the surveys now provide a unique, nationall representative picture of change in British workplaces as reported by individual job holders.  The Skills and Employment Surveys Series Dataset, 1986, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2012 combines data from all 6 surveys in the series, where common survey questions were asked. For each survey, weights are computed to take into account the differential probabilities of sample selection, the over-sampling of certain areas and some small response rate variations between groups (defined by sex, age and occupation). All surveys cover Great Britain except the Skills Survey, 2006 which covers the United Kingdom.  The six surveys are all available separately from the UK Data Archive.

In 1990 the federal government began a major investment in child care with the passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. Support of parental choice was a key component of this new block grant program that sent new money to states to support child care. Parental choice and state control of policy remained central when the program was expanded in 1996 as a part of welfare reform legislation. At that time, child care funding became known as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).  States are required by the CCDF Final Rule to ensure that families receiving child care assistance have equal access to comparable care purchased by private-paying parents. A market rate survey (MRS) is a tool States use to achieve this program objective. Some States conduct surveys to collect the child care market rate and others use administrative data, such as data collected by child care resource and referral (CCR&R) and State licensing agencies, to analyze the market rate for child care.","2016-05-10 14:24:46",,,,,,,"Series - ongoing"

The telephone survey, conducted between November 9, 2008 and January 5, 2009, is the first multiracial and multilingual survey of registered voters across multiple states and regions in a presidential election. In contrast to the 2008 American National Election Study (ANES) which oversampled Black and Latino voters, and was available in Spanish, the CMPS was available in 6 languages and contains robust samples of the four largest racial/ethnic groups: Whites, Latinos, Blacks, Asians. Contains 4,563 respondents who registered to vote in the November 2008 election and who self-identified as Asian, Black, Latino, and White. The survey was available in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese and respondents were offered the opportunity to interview in their language of choice. The 6 states that were sampled to produced robust samples of all 4 major racial groups include California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, and the statewide samples range from 243 to 669 cases. In order to arrive at more nationally representative samples of each minority group, the study added 2 supplemental states per racial group, including Arizona and New Mexico (Latinos), North Carolina and Georgia (Blacks), Hawaii and Washington (Asians). Of these 12 states, 3 were considered political battlegrounds in the 2008 Presidential electorate -- New Mexico, Florida, and North Carolina. In order to examine multi-racial politics in competitive and non-competitive environments, the study supplemented the sample with six additional diverse battleground states: Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. As of the 2008 election, two-thirds of the national electorate was concentrated in these 18 states. For Latinos, 92 percent of all registered voters reside in these states; 87 percent of Asian Americans; and 66 percent of Blacks, and 61 percent of Whites. The November 2008 CMPS provides estimates of the registered voter population by race, age, gender, and education level which was applied to the sample, by racial group, so that the distributions match those of the Census on these important demographic categories. In the study, there are 51 items dealing with sociopolitical attitudes, mobilization and political activity. Additionally, there are 21 items that capture demographic information, including: age, ancestry, birthplace, education, ethnicity, marital status, number in the household, religiosity, gender, media usage and residential context.","2016-05-10 13:25:41",,,,,,,"Single study"

The 2 wards are comprised of 6 villages. There is one health center and 5 dispensaries (3 public and 2 private) in the study area. The 2 wards have 11 government primary schools (at least one in each village) and 2 secondary schools. Both Mwanza city and Magu town are accessible to residents; buses run along the main road and take about an hour and a half to get to Mwanza. Most of the residents are subsistence farmers; a lot of surplus agricultural produce is traded in Mwanza, which is Tanzania's second city. In the year 2012, the research study covered a population of about 30,000 people who live in the Kisesa and Bukandwe wards. The majority of the residents (about 95%) belong to the Sukuma ethnic group.  Collects information on births and deaths and movements in and out of the households. It helps researchers to understand the population dynamics in the study area including fertility, mortality and migration patterns. It provides information on the structure of families that live together. Also used to identify people who are eligible to participate in the serological surveys (the right age group, and continuously resident rather than just visiting). It provides the data for calculating the denominators for demographic rates.  The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to improve understanding of the dynamics of the HIV epidemic; (2) to assess the demographic, social and economic impacts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; (3) to evaluate the effects of national prevention, treatment and care interventions as implemented in Kisesa Ward; (4) to measure child and adult mortality and fertility in the general population and by HIV status; (5) to asses the leading causes of death through verbal autopsy; (6) to assess changes in the family structure due to HIV epidemic; and (7) to provide reliable data for district health planning.","2016-05-10 13:08:21",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

For both interviews, data were collected on contacts with the justice system and satisfaction with those contacts. To measure abuse and one-year outcomes, variables included: values/norms promoting husband's domination, conflict over expectations about gender roles and other aspects of family life, immigration (reasons for immigration, sequencing of husband's and wife's move, each person's legal status), and circumstances related to immigration (discrimination, employment and occupational status, proximity of extended family, wife's support network). Qualitative data on the pattern, nature, and context of the abuse was collected to provide description of why the abuse occurred, and to support findings from the quantitative analysis and/or better specify the causative model. Additional variables included wife's perceptions of immigration law and the outcome of criminal justice involvement; wife's perception of the consequences of divorce (financial, legal realities and cultural norms regarding child custody, effect of marital status on woman's social status and quality of life); need for and effects of wife moving from the ethnic community to the mainstream to escape abuse (need of identification with the ethnic group, support network of relatives and friends, social reactions to abuse); wife's economic power (ability to speak English, earn a living); wife's experience in seeking help (knowledge of United States legal system, availability of legal and victim assistance for abused women, experience with the justice system and victim assistance programs).

In order to identify such realignments, we are interested in comparing the voting behaviour of respondents in the European Parliament election of May 2014 with the subsequent 1st order national election vote here refers to both participation and party choice).","2016-05-10 13:02:34",,,,,,,"Single study"

Instead, adult mortality is estimated from data collected during household-based surveys, by asking respondents about the survival of their siblings. These siblings' survival histories (SSH) are inexpensive to collect but are potentially affected by large errors. As a result, estimates of the level of adult mortality in low-income countries are frequently contested. In this project, we tested whether a new survey instrument helps improve the quality of data on siblings' survival collected during surveys. This new instrument (which we call the \\'siblings' survival calendar\\', SSC) incorporates a number of probes and recall cues to reduce omissions of siblings. It also includes an event history calendar to improve the reporting of dates and ages. We conducted a validation study of this instrument in a rural area of Senegal. During this study, we randomized half the sample of respondents to an interview with the standard SSH instrument, and the other half to an interview with the SSC.

The 19 elections involved 1,046 individuals undertaking 3,082 candidacies. The use of this dataset assumes some familiarity with the single-transferable-vote (STV) system and knowledge of concepts such as nontransferable votes and the need for repeated vote-transfer counts to determine the winners in multimember districts. A majority of the variables involve vote transfers, as these are crucial to the examination of both inter- and intra-party competition in an STV system. The dataset is organized by candidacy and includes records for nontransferable votes.","2015-07-28 08:53:12",,,,,,,"Single study"

The study specifically focused on British Asian and White English children aged 6-8 and 9-11 years, who were 1st generation immigrants (N=40), 2nd generation immigrants (N =178 ) and white English (N =180 ). This research aimed to further our understanding of social developmental processes involved in the acculturation of young immigrant children and consisted of a 12 month longitudinal study, with 3 testing points at 6 month intervals. This allowed us to track identity and acculturation changes developmentally. It also allowed us to examine causal relationships between variables. Both qualitative and quantitative interview techniques were used. Children completed quantitative measures of ethnic and English identification, acculturation strategy, perceived acculturation strategy of the ethnic out-group and experience of racist discrimination. The relationship between these variables and reported ethnic in- and out-group friends, in-group bias, peer acceptance and self-esteem were also examined using quantitative techniques. Two qualitative studies were also conducted, the first examining Social Capital (N=32) and the second examining Social Capital and acculturation in refugee children (N=8). This research informs our theoretical understanding of children's social development, and their attachment to their ethnic groups, and also social policy concerned with improving the integration of immigrant children into schools.","2016-05-10 12:53:26",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

It hones in on post-war developments in so-called de facto, or unrecognized, states. The survey deposited here took place in Nagorno Karabakh in September 2013. Nagorno Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan, but it has functioned as a de facto state since the war with its parent state Azerbaijan in 1988-1993. The survey, which covers 1,000 respondents over the age of 18, asks people questions about their views on their present political, social, economic, and security situation, as well as their experiences of violence in the war of 1988-1993. The survey respondents were selected randomly from eight primary sampling units (the capital and the 7 regions controlled by the Nagorno Karabakh authorities). Participation was entirely voluntary, and the survey responses are anonymous. The survey questions were asked in the respondents' native tongue, by professionally trained interviewers.

The study, known in abbreviated form as the Immigrant Identity Project, was organized as a sub-project of two larger investigations: the Mexican Migration Project and the Latin American Migration Project. The project sought to conduct in-depth interviews with immigrants residing in the northeastern United States , and was originally conceived to analyze whether the construction of immigrant identity conformed to the postulates of classic assimilation theory, segmented assimilation theory, or transnational theory, and to assess whether intergroup boundaries were being blurred or brightened.  The project design called for recruiting a quota sample of first and second generation immigrants in the urban corridor that stretches from New York City through New Jersey to Philadelphia. Although New York and its suburbs in northern New Jersey are traditional immigrant gateways of long standing, Philadelphia and its suburbs in southern New Jersey only recently began to receive significant migration from Mexico, Central, and South America. Our sampling quotas were defined by the cross-classification of location (Philadelphia, New Jersey, and New York), origin (Caribbean, Mexican, Central American, South American), and generation (first or second), yielding a 3x4x2 social space of 24 cells. Within each cell we sought to compile ten interviews roughly balanced between males and females, for a target of 240 interviews. We recruited young immigrants between the ages of 13 and 35 years, though we did not exclude those who fell outside these bounds.","2016-05-10 12:46:07",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Also describes the Graduation Success Rate (GSR) for all Division I institutions and the Academic Success Rate (ASR) of all Division II institutions. The rates included in this study are based on championship sport student-athletes who first began their full-time postsecondary education in academic years 1995-96 through 2008-09. Each cohort was tracked for 6 years for college completion. For example, the graduation status for the latest cohort (2008-09 cohort) was tracked through the spring of 2014. At their core, all 3 measures are based on a comparison of the number of students who entered a college or university in a given year and the number of those who graduated within six years of their initial enrollment, though each measure has a slightly different cohort definition. Federal graduation rates are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Graduation Rates (IPEDS-GRS) which is defined as a 6-year proportion of those student-athletes who graduated versus those who entered an institution on institutional aid. Federal graduation rates are included for both an institution's student-athletes and its general student body.  In addition to the student-athlete data in the graduation-rates data, the Division I Graduation Success Rate (GSR) accounts for student-athletes who transfer into an institution while discounting student-athletes who separate from the institution and would have been academically eligible to compete had they returned. The definition of the Division II Academic Success Rate (ASR) cohort is identical to that of the GSR with the exception that it also includes freshmen who did not receive athletics aid, but did participate in athletics.","2016-05-10 12:44:57",,,,,,,"Series - completed"

Examines democratic consolidation in Mexico through the lens of electoral politics and documents how the mass public, the candidates, the political parties, and the media interact to shape the subjects of electoral contests - taking into account the possibility that political elites may anticipate the preferences of ordinary citizens and of other elites. Goal was to understand why electoral campaigns highlight or downplay certain issues, and to assess the implications of these dynamics for democratic governance. Some of the questions in this study include \\'Who sets the agenda in Mexican elections?\\', \\'To what extent does this agenda respond to, engage, or ignore ordinary citizens?\\', and \\'What do the dynamics of 'issue emergence' mean for democratic representation?\\'. Demographic variables include, age, sex, civil/marital status, education, income, occupation, social class, and religion.","2016-05-10 12:22:42",,,,,,,"Single study"

In the study area, in four districts of Nampula province, farmers are generally far from towns where agricultural input providers are based and formal banking services are available. In absence of these services, smallholders typically face liquidity constraints during the planting season when returns to input usage are the highest. In order to explore potential policy solutions to this challenge, the project combines training and incentives to use mobile money technology alongside targeted input marketing visits to promote formal saving strategies and increase take-up of basic inputs, primarily seeds and fertilizer. The goal of the pilot project was to determine whether combining group-level trainings in mobile money technology with targeted direct marketing could increase input usage, and consequently boost agricultural productivity.","2016-06-10 15:18:53",,,,,,,"Series - ongoing"

Comprises 3 coordinated longitudinal studies: Denver Youth Survey, Pittsburgh Youth Study and Rochester Youth Development Study. The 3 projects used a similar research design. All of the projects were longitudinal investigations involving repeated contacts with youth during a substantial portion of their developmental years.  Researchers conducted regular face-to-face interviews with inner-city youth considered at high-risk for involvement in delinquency and drug abuse. Multiple perspectives on each child's development and behavior were obtained through interviews with the child's primary caretaker and, in two sites, school teachers. Administrative data from official agencies, including police, schools and social services was also collected. The 3 research teams worked together to ensure that certain core measures were identical across the sites, including self-reported delinquency and drug use; community and neighborhood characteristics; youth, family and peer variables; and arrest and judicial processing histories.","2016-06-29 10:55:56",,,,,,,"Series - completed"
