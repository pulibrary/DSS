"Colombia River Stories Datasets Archive, 1994-2020","<p>The goal of the project is the environmental monitoring of water resources using an innovative and multi-disciplinary methodology that brings social scientists and natural scientists together - integrating their research methods and techniques to capture human stories through community-level\, participatory research and the river&#39;s story through field-based scientific monitoring and environmental reconstruction and mapping. The social science data of the project includes in-depth life history style interviews with individuals from the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities of the Atrato. The project used purposive sampling\, recruiting participants through local contacts and then &lsquo;snowballing&rsquo; for additional participants. As part of our citizen science programme\, monitoring of the Rio Quito was carried out on a weekly basis by a local community. The monitoring consisted of measurement of in-situ parameters (turbidity\, pH\, conductivity\, dissolved oxygen and temperature) and water sampling of Rio Quito. They also monitored the bacterial contamination of their drinking water. The hydrogeochemical data sets were based on a range of analytical results carried out on water (river and rain) and soil (riverbank and river bottom) samples\, predominantly from the Rio Quito and the town of Quibdo. The parameters being acquired were the water temperature\, pH\, specific electrical conductivity (SEC)\, total dissolved solids (TDS)\, oxidation reduction potential (ORP)\, dissolved oxygen (DO)\, alkalinity\, major anion and cations\, water stable isotopes and suite of dissolved and total metals in water. The satellite images archive consists of temporal satellite images between 1994- 2020 that were pre-processed and processed in order to highlight changes that were observed along the river bank due to anthropogenic action. A temporal change detection analysis has been evaluated by highlighting the observed changes through time. Atrato Subcatchment Sediment Load Estimation &amp; analysis of mining impacts on the planform of the Rio Quito quantifies the ways and extent to which alluvial gold mining in the Choc&oacute; has impacted the geomorphological form and function of the rivers in which it occurs. It specifically focusses on the assessment of mining impacts on: 1. total river sediment loads; 2. river suspended sediment concentration and turbidity; 3. river channel planform. The results presented contribute to the wider project objective of understanding the ways in which mining-driven changes to river form and function intersect with\, and influence\, the socio-economic\, social-political\, and socio-cultural systems that drive alluvial gold mining and conflict in the Choc&oacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colombia is in the process of transitioning from one of the most protracted civil conflicts in the world to peace. However\, one of the major societal issues for post-conflict transitions in Colombia is how to ensure the inclusion and participation of vulnerable and marginalised groups in transition processes so that their knowledges\, abilities and capacities are represented\, and so that they can influence post-conflict development. This raises questions of how innovative community- engaged and participatory processes can achieve greater inclusivity in peace building processes. It also raises the question of how different conflict actors can be encouraged and facilitated to articulate their knowledge and experience of conflict in ways that enable their actions to be explained to one another\, and that support a shift from narrow understandings of the causes of conflict based on personal experience to more expansive understandings that are based on collective experiences. In this research\, we focus on riverine communities along the Atrato River - the main artery of Choco. These communities have been deeply impacted by armed actors who are engaged in widespread\, illegal alluvial gold mining which is a key factor in their forced displacement and the loss of traditional\, sustainable livelihoods. Despite a 2017 Colombian Constitutional Court ruling to empower riverine communities with &#39;bio-cultural rights&#39; that protect their land title and livelihoods\, they remain marginalised. They struggle to make their voices heard and to influence and inform peace building processes. This marginalisation has also been experienced by the river itself\, whose voice has been silenced through the abandonment of state-sponsored environmental monitoring programmes at the height of the conflict. As a result\, the effects of conflict and alluvial mining on the form and function of the river\, and the impacts of these on interactions between armed actors\, the river\, and the communities it sustains are poorly understood. This will only be addressed if marginalised voices of communities and the river are articulated and amplified so that their knowledges\, abilities and capacities can be integrated into sustainable peace building processes. Achieving this is the primary aim of this project. Conceptually\, our project builds on a key emphasis of peace processes worldwide: the capture and re-telling of testimony so that conflict actors can better appreciate the complexities of the conflict in which they are engaged\, and the inter-relationships and feedbacks between their actions\, and those of others\, which fuel the conflict. Such knowledge is a fundamental precursor to the development of sustainable and feasible strategies for peace. The project is structured and designed to elicit\, analyse and co-produce testimonies as an integrated &#39;river story&#39;\, sourced from multiple participants and perspectives - including marginalised human actors and the river itself. The project therefore uses an innovative and multi- disciplinary methodology that brings social scientists and natural scientists together - integrating their research methods and techniques to capture human stories through community-level\, participatory research and the river&#39;s story through field- based scientific monitoring and environmental reconstruction and mapping. The story books that are produced\, and the policy briefs that they underpin\, will be the vehicles through which policy-makers are bought into dialogue with the marginalised voices of both riverine communities and the river itself\, and thorough which they improved understandings of the key actors and drivers of conflict in Choco&#39; and the priorities and strategies for sustainable peace building\, will be gained.

"Water Quality Model Outputs for an Urban River in Birmingham, 2013-2014","<p>An hourly dynamic model was set up to simulate the water quality along a 12 km stretch of an urban river in Birmingham (River Rea). The model was tested over a two year period and then used to simulate the beneficial impact of establishing tree coverage either uniformly within the catchment area or targeted along the river banks. In achieving this\, the process-based approach represents (1) the impacts of pollutant uptake from runoff by trees and (2) the light attenuation by canopies reducing the solar radiation reaching the water column which cools the river and slows down eutrophication and oxygen consumption. See metadata file for specific details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global ambitions to reduce environmental impacts of cities through sustainable urbanisation are likely to be undermined under future climate conditions. There is an urgent need to consider proposed solutions in an integrated manner in terms of the resulting air\, soil and water quality\, to evaluate the consequences for ecosystem services\, and to make the assessments at both local and regional scales. In urban environments increasingly vulnerable to climate change\, it is argued that the process of planning effective mitigation (for example of flooding) must include assessment of a range of innovative nature-based and technical-natural solutions evaluated against multiple criteria. Whilst specific solutions might be beneficial at small scale in single domains\, what is less tractable are the likely co-benefits or trade-offs in other domains or within a wider urban and peri-urban context. The benefits to people come about through flows of air and water through urban landscapes\, so understanding scale and context for both social and natural systems are essential to effective planning for liveable cities. Our project focuses on identifying holistic multi-domain solutions and evaluating their overall effectiveness at various scales in case study systems\, primarily in China but also in Europe. It will make use of new and existing case studies to evaluate what leads to successful interventions\, and the role of business and society in this. It is an integrated business-research collaboration comprising a collaborative process of learning. Refinement of our research tools will be actively driven through innovative environmental initiatives from the business sector. From that\, an iterative process further stimulating innovation will be fostered by the project.</p>\r\n"
"Stakeholder Workshops on Floods and Droughts Adaptation in the Limpopo River Basin, 2021-2022","<p>The collection contains a summary of the stakeholder interactive sessions on floods and droughts adaptation in the Limpopo River Basin\, Southern Africa\, held at national and transboundary levels during the period 2021-2022\, as part of the NERC-funded Connect4WR project. Workshops aimed to co-create management solutions to reduce impacts and increase benefits of drought-flood cycles throughout the Limpopo River Basin. They explored the combination of suitable and widely supported engineering and soft-path management solutions using an iterative\, coproduction process to strengthen bridges between scientists and water management stakeholders at local\, national and transboundary scales. Three specific key questions were considered: (i) How can the increased understanding of historic drought-flood cycles be used for the development of future management scenarios?; (ii) Which processes and communication pathways can be developed or improved between managers/policy makers and local water uses to reduce negative impacts and increase resilience towards drought-flood cycles?; (iii) How can long-term transboundary physical and social connections be built to increase basin-scale resilience to alternating hydrological extremes? The collection contains four datasets: (1) Summary of the transboundary stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 2-3 June 2021\, in partnership with LIMCOM\, IWMI and the SADC&#39;s Groundwater Management Institute. (2) Summary of the South Africa stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 25 April 2022. (3) Summary of the Botswana stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually and in person (i.e. hybrid) on 5 May 2022. (4) Summary of the Zimbabwe stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 12 May 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;CONNECT4 water resilience&#39; project brings together a multidisciplinary team of hydrologists and sociologists from academia\, policy and practice in the UK\, Botswana\, South Africa\, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to investigate the physical and societal factors affecting vulnerability and resilience to drought and floods in 4 countries of the Limpopo River Basin (LRB). The research will provide a better understanding of the connectivity within and between physical and social aspects of vulnerability to improve societal preparedness and resilience to flood and drought hazards in arid Sub-Saharan regions. The LRB is an arid\, water-stressed basin\, yet with high susceptibility to floods. It encompasses a large diversity of physical and socio-economical characteristics spread across four countries (Botswana\, South Africa\, Zimbabwe and Mozambique). Floods and droughts have been shown to exacerbate water availability and quality problems and are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude. We will focus on the challenges and opportunities during floods following droughts in the LRB\, when aquifers and communities are already under stress\, and when appropriate flood management could improve short term coping mechanisms and long-term resilience for future dry seasons. We will explore to what extent geographical differences between sub-regions influence how water resources respond to\, and how people cope with floods and droughts in order to inform appropriate water management strategies at various scales (local to transnational). The research will articulate around three integrated workpackages (WP). WP1 will assess basin-scale hydrological connectivity\, i.e. how droughts and floods propagate in space and time under varying physical conditions (hydrometeorology\, physiography\, geology\, groundwater-surface water interactions)\, with a focus on how the hydrological response of a specific sub-region influences or is influenced by other regions. This will be achieved though implementation of a basin-scale groundwater-surface water modelling approach and based on existing datasets\, in part collected by the project team. Outputs will aid to improve transnational flood and drought monitoring networks and update susceptibility mapping. WP2 will assess the basin-scale social connectivity\, i.e. how drought-flood cycles are understood\, anticipated and worked with by local communities and how these communities interact with governance institutions. This will be achieved by carrying out interviews with diverse community groups and with key community-government intermediaries such as extension officers and catchment management fora. Outputs will contribute to understanding how drought/flood risk is perceived by communities and to develop better communication. WP3 will integrate WP1 and WP2 and will work on the connectivity between social and hydrological systems. It will connect our understanding of multiscale hydrological processes underlying alternating droughts and floods with water resource and risk management\, and societal preparedness pathways. This aims to co-create management solutions to reduce impacts and increase benefits of drought-flood cycles throughout the LRB. It will use an iterative\, co-production process to strengthen crucial bridges between scientists and water management stakeholders on the appropriate scale(s). Research outputs will impact (1) people in the LRB and arid regions through enhanced awareness and preparedness to flood and droughts\, leading to increased resilience; (2) local and regional authorities via improved hydrological monitoring networks and a strengthened connection from local to transnational levels of governance; (3) general public through public engagement activities; (4) international academics via publications and socio-hydrological datasets on public databases\, training of African under- and postgraduate students and development of early career researchers.</p>\r\n"
"Optimizing Water Resources Allocation Under Climate Change Scenarios: A Case of Great Ruaha River Subbasin, Tanzania, 2021","<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study undertook extensive fieldwork and data collection in the Rufiji Basin\, conducted from September 27th to October 8th\, 2021. The primary objectives were to introduce the Research Assistants (RA&rsquo;s) and the RESBEN project to the Rufiji Basin Water Board (RBWB)\, establish valuable contacts\, select sample sites for qualitative work\, and gain a comprehensive understanding of the district and catchments under examination. Key aims included the collection of climate data\, hydrological reports\, water abstraction data\, and insights into local irrigation schemes and water abstraction points. The data collected during the first phase encompassed water abstraction records\, rainfall data from 17 stations\, streamflow data from 14 stations\, borehole data including location\, depths\, and yields\, and reservoir data such as turbine discharge\, spillway discharge\, net evaporation\, and elevation-volume curves. The study&#39;s main objective was to optimize water allocation among competing users in the Great Ruaha River subbasin. The research sought to answer critical questions concerning the effects of climate change on water availability\, variations in surface and groundwater potential\, and the optimization of water allocation considering diverse climatic and development circumstances. The study&#39;s results have been effectively shared to water users\, watershed managers\, and other stakeholders via a Systemic Adaptive Management (SAM) workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustainable water resource development remains elusive because development has largely externalized costs to the environment and vulnerable people. There is a need for novel research theory\, methodologies &amp; practice in order to meet the UN SDGs and realise the Africa Water Vision 2025. We propose to launch an innovative research approach: the Adaptive Systemic Approach (ASA). Our aim is to apply transformative\, transdisciplinary\, community-engaged research\, to shift water development outcomes towards achieving the SDGs. We focus on continental water development priorities: water supply and pollution. This collaboration brings together the ARUA Water Centre of Excellence (CoE) and UK partner\, the University of Sheffield (UoS). The 8 CoE nodes are: i) Addis Ababa U\, Ethiopia; U Rwanda\, Rwanda; U Cheikh Anta Diop\, Senegal; Dar es Salaam U\, Tanzania\, Makerere U\, Uganda (DAC least developed); ii) U Lagos\, Nigeria (DAC lower-middle income); and iii) U Cape Town\, Rhodes U (CoE Hub)\, South Africa (DAC upper-middle income). We propose a country-based Case Study structure to support local research development and pathways to local impact (Figure 1 in Case for Support). We use an SDG6 (water and sanitation) centred model\, that links SDGs related to landscape water resources with SDGs related to water services. (This model underpins the successful UKRI:GCRF Capability Grant:&quot;Water for African SDGs&quot;). We raise three research questions (RQ) related to water development priorities. Three catchment-based Case Studies address RQ1: HOW IS WATER USED\, TO WHOSE BENEFIT? (Rufigi R Tanzania\, Senegal R Senegal\, and Blue Nile R Ethiopia). Two Case Studies focus on urban water pollution (Kampala City Uganda and Lagos City Nigeria)\, addressing RQ2: WHAT ARE THE SOURCES\, PATHWAYS AND IMPACT OF POLLUTION IN URBAN WATER SYSTEMS? A cross-cutting Case Study addresses water resource protection and biodiversity in all CSs\, and a biodiversity site in Rwanda. By the completion of the project we commit to leaving local people effectively linked with institutions making decisions about water that affect them. Therefore all Case Studies address the question RQ3: HOW CAN LOCAL CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE BE DEVELOPED FOR: I) EQUITABLE WATER SHARING\, II) COMMUNITY POLLUTION RESILIENCE\, AND III) ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION AND RESTORATION? The novel Adaptive Systemic Approach (ASA) provides a coherent methodological framework that will support Case Study comparisons\, changed water development practice\, and will embed pathways to impact throughout the project. The ASA requires engaged research\, and draws on three core theoretical concepts\, with associated methods: Complex Social-Ecological Systems\, Transdisciplinarity\, and Transformative Social Learning (Elaborated in Case for Support). These concepts underpin four ASA steps\, followed in each Case Study: 1. BOUND: Researchers engage with a full range of stakeholders to identify a relevant\, local\, water-development issue\, and scope the Case Study. 2. ADAPTIVE PLANNING PROCESS: Stakeholders co-create a contextually informed vision of the future state of their selected local issue\, and co-develop an objectives hierarchy to move towards resolving the issue. 3. CONCURRENT ACTIVITIES 3.1 RESEARCH Each Case study team addresses the specific research questions\, delivering data for resolving the problem. 3.2 PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT Local people\, formal\, and traditional\, water governance institutions together move towards local people being part of land and water decision-making. 3.3 STRATEGIC ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT (SAM) - stakeholders will be trained in a process for systemic\, responsive\, contextual\, co-management. 4. PARTICIPATORY MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF REFLEXIVE LEARNING Researchers and stakeholders co-develop indicators\, co-monitor\, co-reflect on progress\, co-learn and adapt\, using SAM. Following the ASA in the case studies embeds the theory of change\, and the pathways to impact.</p>\r\n"
"Resilient Mangrove Systems: Questionnaires, Participatory GIS, and Focus Groups in Mangrove Socio-ecological Systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, 2018-2019","<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA. These data were generated in two mangrove socio-ecological systems in the north and south of the Red River Delta with different environmental and socio-economic histories. The research included: a) questionnaires (n=300) with households at each site to quantify household economy and adaptive capacity information and explore spatially explicit perceptions about mangrove ecosystem services; b) in-depth livelihood trajectory interviews (n=20) with households representing different adaptive capacity profiles; c) focus group discussions (n=6) to explore plausible future scenarios that impact the mangrove system with households representing different adaptive capacity profiles; and d) in-depth interviews (n=18) with key informants from relevant Ministries\, local government departments and civic groups. Datasets can be used as stand-alone\, yet richer analysis can be done linking the various sources of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangroves provide multiple benefits from carbon storage and shoreline protection at global and national scales\, to food and energy for natural resource-dependent coastal communities at local scale. However\, mangroves are coming under increasing pressure due to land use changes resulting from climate change\, coastal development and aquaculture. In Vietnam the area under mangrove forest declined by 35% between 1983 and 2012\, increasing vulnerability of the coast to tidal surges\, hurricanes and saline intrusion as well as reducing the availability and accessibility of mangrove resources necessary to support livelihoods. Previous research in Vietnam has taken a largely technical approach to the relationship between mangrove protection\, restoration and aquaculture and has not paid adequate attention to socio-economic factors. This research aims to evaluate socio-ecological resilience in Vietnamese mangroves in the Red River Delta and evaluate management options to enhance delivery of benefits and services across multiple scales\, using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates ecology; remote sensing and GIS; and social research methods on livelihoods and scenario evaluation. By doing so\, this research will contribute to a) the livelihoods and resilience of mangrove dependent communities\, b) the on-going delivery of ecosystem services across scales\, while at the same time c) through stakeholder engagement and knowledge exchange throughout\, building the capacity for conservation and sustainable management of mangroves in Vietnam.</p>\r\n"

Ethiopia Nile Basin Climate Change Adaptation Dataset,<p>The household survey was carried out in the Nile River Basin in Ethiopia. The household sampling frame in Ethiopia was developed to ensure representation for the Nile River Basin at the woreda (district) level regarding level of rainfall patterns in terms of both annual total and variation; the 4 classes of traditionally defined agro-ecological zones (AEZs) found in the basin; vulnerability of food production systems (through the proxy of frequency of food aid in the past 10 years); and irrigation prevalence.</p>\r\n
"  Post-Distribution Monitoring of Cash-Based Intervention  Nigeria, (2019, 2020, 2022)","<p>The UNHCR conducted a Cash-Based Intervention (CBI) in mid-2022 for refugees in Ogoja and Kwande\, Cross River and Benue States\, Nigeria. This post-distribution monitoring survey\, carried out from August 5 to 9\, 2022\, aimed to evaluate the intervention&rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency. Data was collected from over 800 beneficiary households (207 in Kwande and 623 in Ogoja)\, distributed by household size. Data collection used stratified random sampling and face-to-face interviews\, ensuring comprehensive feedback for program monitoring and improvement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late December 2021\, the UNHCR provided cash assistance for food to 20\,000 Cameroonian refugees in Ogoja and Ikyogen (Cross River and Benue States)\, followed by bank transfers to another 4\,000 refugee families in early January 2022. This Cash-Based Intervention (CBI) aimed to mitigate the social and economic impacts of COVID-19. A Post-Distribution Monitoring survey was conducted from March 1 to 12\, 2022\, interviewing over 800 heads of beneficiary households to assess the intervention&amp;#039;s effectiveness and efficiency. Data was collected using stratified random sampling and face-to-face interviews\, ensuring comprehensive feedback for program monitoring and improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey collects data on refugee households that received cash assistance in the Nigerian states of Cross River and Benue. The survey records information from over 750 households across settlements\, including Ikyogen\, Adagom 1\, 2\, 3\, and Okende. It provides insights into how the cash assistance was utilized and the overall impact on household needs. Conducted in August 2020\, the survey informs future UNHCR interventions. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a cluster-stratified sampling approach and anonymized to protect personal information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dataset captures the outcomes of a post-distribution monitoring survey conducted by UNHCR in December 2019. The survey evaluated the impact of the second cash-assistance intervention provided to refugees in Ogoja and Kwande\, located in Cross River and Benue States\, Nigeria. The cash-assistance aimed to support various refugee needs\, including food\, shelter\, non-food items\, health\, and education. Over 950 households were interviewed between December 15-18\, 2019\, using a face-to-face interview technique. The data collection followed a stratified random sampling procedure\, focusing on location and household size. The primary purpose of the dataset is to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the cash-based interventions under UNHCR&amp;#039;s protection mandate. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for program monitoring\, operational planning\, and understanding the needs and outcomes of cash-assistance programs for refugees in Nigeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cash-Based Interventions Post-Distribution Monitoring contains data from a post-distribution monitoring survey conducted by UNHCR in Nigeria between July 25th and 30th\, 2019.

"Using Participatory Approaches To Instigate Improvements in Water Quality, 2021-2022","<p>The &lsquo;UpStream&rsquo; project was co-created\, co-developed and co-delivered with two active community groups in the UK (Friends of Bradford&#39;s Becks) and Taiwan (Taiwan Clean Water Alliance) who both were concerned about water pollution in their local rivers. The project has provided a testbed to achieve the aim of the project of aiding citizen scientists better understand local water quality. This has led to the development and deployment of a cost-effective Continuous Water Quality Monitoring device\, the WaterBox\, along with methods for transmitting\, storing\, visualising\, and analysing the data collected. Parameters collected include: pH\, temperature\, conductivity and turbidity. A total of 104 practicalities of continuous water quality monitoring were observed and categorised as either technical\, social\, economic or wider responsibilities. These have been summarised in a publication that is current;y under review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UpStream project aims to improve water quality in the UK and Taiwan by working with citizens to gather data\, share knowledge and experiences\, and develop new technologies. Motivated by environmental issues already identified by the public\, this participatory project will increase connectivity and action across a range of organisations and community groups. Both the UK and Taiwan have problems with pollution of rivers. Across Europe\, laws state that river water quality should not be impacted by human activity\, but latest assessments suggest that just 38% of waters meet this standard. In Taiwan\, rapid industrialisation and economic growth have had an impact on water pollution. In 2016\, 65% of Taiwanese rivers were classed as moderately polluted. As economic growth stabilises and society evolves\, attention is shifting to water quality issues; tighter water quality standards have been set and are incorporated into the government&#39;s Forward-looking Infrastructure plan. In both the UK and Taiwan citizens feel strongly about water quality\, and have founded local community action groups to instigate improvements. The UpStream project aims to improve water quality in the UK and Taiwan by creating an innovative partnership between these community groups and a range of academic and non-academic organisations to gather data\, share knowledge and experiences\, and develop new technologies. The project partners from Taiwan (Academia Sinica\, NTU and Location Aware Sensing System (LASS)) are experts in creating innovative technology with citizens that leads to real environmental improvements. They have developed low-cost air quality sensors that are now installed in 4\,000 locations across Taiwan\, and that feed into apps to help citizens avoid air pollution. Our UK partners at Newcastle University\, Rain++ and RPS are experts in mobilising citizen science to address water problems. They have worked with the public on water issues in the UK and internationally for over 15 years. Our new and unique partnership will combine Taiwanese expertise in co-creating technology with citizens with UK expertise in water to empower citizens in both countries to improve water quality. Lack of water quality data to identify sources of pollution is a common problem in both countries\, and our project aims to fix that. Benefits and direct outputs of the activities planned through the project will include: -Community groups will benefit from technical advice and a new\, international support network. -A natural legacy for citizen-led environmental management through the involvement of students and community groups. -The involvement of tech start-ups that can provide insights into water quality\, through their inclusion in the project team (LASS\, Rain++\, FondUS). -Any data or tools created through the project will follow open data protocols\, making them accessible to local communities\, interested researchers and businesses. The co-production of data (evidence) and tools will empower community groups to manage their local environment alongside relevant organisations after the project has ended. -Policy makers and regulators will have access to the open data collected through our project and will participate in talks through the project\, helping to initiate change. -A prototype data visualisation and analysis tool\, to aid understanding of water quality issues. -A scope for follow-on work\, to continue the work of our unique partnership. Whilst the legislative and societal contexts differ\, Taiwan and the UK (and beyond) share common challenges with river pollution. Both have citizens that want to get involved and see change. The UpStream project aims to help by bringing together citizens with academic and industry partners for knowledge-exchange and long-term support.</p>\r\n"
Increasing Women's Access to Skilled Pregnancy Care in Rural Nigeria (2017-2020),"<p>The project&#39;s specific objectives are: 1) to identify the demand and supply factors responsible for the use and non-use of PHCs for pregnancy care in Esan South East and Etsako East LGAs of Edo State\, Nigeria; 2) based on Objective 1\, to derive and implement a set of multi-faceted community-led interventions to increase women&#39;s access to skilled pregnancy care offered in PHCs in Esan South East&nbsp; and Etsako East Local Government Areas (LGA); and 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions using both indicators of access to services\, as well as maternal and fetal/newborn health outcomes in the intervention communities. &nbsp; The study was conducted in Esan South East and Etsako East Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Edo State in southern Nigeria.&nbsp; Both LGAs are located in the rural and riverine areas of the state\, adjacent to River Niger\, with Estako East in the northern part of the Edo State part of the river\, while Esan South East is in the southern part. Edo State is one of Nigeria&rsquo;s 36 states. Each state consists of LGAs\, and LGAs consist of political/health Wards. Originally designed to be a randomized control trial (Yaya et al.\, 2018) but was changed to a quasi-experiment separate sample pretest and posttest design. The change was necessitated by the difficulty in achieving reliable randomization in the study communities. The study was conducted in 3 phases. At phase one\, a baseline was conducted using a mixed-method approach to address objective 1. Based on the results of the baseline research\, a set of intervention activities were designed and implemented simultaneously in phase 2 for two years. Phase 3 was the endline research which addressed the study objective 3. &nbsp; The data contains baseline and endline data. collected through a mixed-method approach to address the study objectives.&nbsp; The baseline data were collected between July 29 to August 16\, 2017\, using a mixed-method that comprises a household survey\, exit interview\, PHC site assessment survey\, community conversation\, focus group discussion\, and key informant interview. The endline data were collected between June 24 and July 6\, 2020\, using a household survey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
"Transportation Revolution and the English Coal Industry, 1695–1842: A Geographical Approach","<p>Cross sections of coal prices in England for 1695\, 1795\, and 1842 are used to infer transportation rates by sea\, river\, canal\, and road. The effectiveness of monopolies\, the degree of market integration\, and the patterns of regional supply of each mining district are then established. The growth rates of productivity in sea\, river\, and road transport from 1695&ndash;1842 are computed and combined with a social savings assessment of canals to measure the overall growth in the productivity of shipping coal.

"Data and Code for: Economic Effects of Environmental Crises: Evidence from Flint, Michiganv","<p>In April 2014\, Flint\, Michigan switched its drinking water supply from the Detroit water system to the Flint River as a temporary means to save $5M. Over eighteen months\, it was revealed that the switch exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead\, culminating in an emergency declaration in October 2015. This paper examines the impact of this crisis on the Flint housing market. The value of Flint&#39;s housing stock has fallen by $520M to $559M despite over $400M in remediation spending. Home prices remain depressed through August 2019\, sixteen months after the water was declared safe for consumption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Geographic Coverage:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michigan\, Ohio\, New Jersey\, Indiana\, Connecticut</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time Period:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1/2006 &ndash; 8/2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Data Type(s):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;administrative records data; aggregate data; census/enumeration data; event/transaction data; geographic information system (GIS) data; observational data</p>\r\n"
"North Dakota Health Insurance Survey, 1998","<p>The objectives of this survey were (1) to determine who the uninsured were in North Dakota\, (2) to show how the 1997 flood affected Grand Forks and other Red River Valley residents\, (3) to provide information to help government and private industry respond to the needs of disaster survivors\, and (4) to update the results of the 1993 health care survey conducted under the State Initiatives in Health Care Reform Program (ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION EMPLOYER HEALTH INSURANCE SURVEY\, 1993 [ICPSR 6908] and ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION FAMILY HEALTH INSURANCE SURVEY\, 1993 [ICPSR 6894]). The interview collected information on household composition\, health insurance status for each member of the household\, impact of the flood\, and demographic characteristics such as employment status\, age\, sex\, and income. All households with at least one uninsured individual were administered a needs assessment module to collect more detailed information on health care coverage\, utilization\, and needs\, as well as additional demographic information. Data are presented at the person level and the &quot;family insurance unit&quot; (FIU) level\, a grouping typically used by insurance carriers. A FIU comprises an adult household member\, his or her spouse\, if any\, and any dependent children 0-17 years of age\, or 18-22 years of age if unmarried full-time students.</p>\r\n"
"Household Survey to Value Ecosystem Services and Disservices of Sponge Parks in Can Tho, Vietnam, 2021","<p>Data was collected in an in-person household survey in Can Tho\, Vietnam. Respondents were interviewed in central locations in randomly selected wards and subwards across the centre of the city. The survey covered the perception and use of green and blue spaces in the city. At its core it contains a discrete choice experiment to value a set of ecosystem services and disservices of urban parks: flood management\, recreational facilities and (desirable and undesirable) biodiversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flooding is the most damaging and costly hydrometeorological hazard affecting millions of people globally every year. In Viet Nam\, low-lying coastal cities\, particularly in river deltas\, face increased flood risk and vulnerability due to rapid urban development and climate change. To reduce flood risk in urban areas\, the recent decade has seen increased appreciation of the potential of Blue/Green Infrastructure (BGI)\, such as natural and man-made wetlands\, vegetated river banks and restored floodplains\, to reduce flood risk and provide additional benefits\, such as controlling water pollutants\, providing recreational opportunities\, improving air quality and increasing resilience to other stressors\, such as heat waves and noise pollution. However\, despite the growing interest in BGI in a flood risk management context\, assessments of the effectiveness and viability of such measures have in the past been mostly piecemeal\, focusing on individual impacts of such measures (e.g. flood risk reduction\, provision of urban green space). Such sectorial assessments cannot account for the potential trade-offs or complementarities between the multiple impacts of individual installations\, let alone whole networks of BGI. Therefore\, ValBGI seeks to develop a multidisciplinary\, stakeholder-informed assessment framework for the effectiveness of BGI to reduce flood risk and improve urban natural capital. Thereby\, the project examines the role of BGI in short- and long-term urban development\, with application to the city of Can Tho\, Viet Nam. This holistic framework integrates a number of disciplines and does not only follow an interlinked and multidisciplinary research agenda but also advances the academic state-of-the-art in the individual disciplines involved. This includes the engagement of key stakeholders in the research process to co-develop solutions and disseminate evidence to key decision-makers; innovative high-resolution modelling of flooding and BGI at the city-scale; and spatially explicit assessment and valuation of changes in the provision of ecosystem services enabling the quantification of the investment into urban natural capital effectuated by BGI. To achieve these objectives\, the project comprises four work packages which function as interlinked components within the multidisciplinary assessment framework: (1) The operational backbone of ValBGI is a work package that establishes a stakeholder group to work alongside the research team from start to end. This component assesses (and when necessary stimulates) the awareness of alternative natural processes-based BGI options among local and regional urban planners and other key stakeholders. (2) A second work package reviews existing flood models for Can Tho and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta and develops a new high-resolution modelling system to assess the effectiveness of selected BGI measures in reducing flood risk. (3) In the third work package\, changes in the provision of ecosystem services following the installation of BGI measures will be assessed and mapped. (4) In the fourth work package costs and benefits of BGI measures (in terms of flood risk reductions and improvements of urban natural capital) are quantified by means of valuation\, and cost-benefit analyses of BGI scenarios are conducted. The continuous stakeholder engagement in ValBGI ensures awareness for and uptake of the research outcomes by decision-makers to maximise impact of the evidence produced. Furthermore\, the holistic approach provides a better understanding of the potential trade-offs and complementarities between flood risk reduction and improvement of natural capital generated by BGI. Exploring all simultaneous impacts of BGI is beneficial in providing environmental managers and urban planners with a complete array of information for supporting planning decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA.</p>\r\n"

"REACH Dhaka WASH Household Survey, 2017-2018","<p>The REACH Dhaka WASH Household Survey was conducted between December 2017 and February 2018 to collect quantitative data on various indicators of multidimensional poverty\, the state of drinking water services and sanitation facilities\, household expenditures\, illnesses in the past year and priority concerns for development. The survey was carried out along a 25km stretch of river (Turag and Tongi-Khal) in northern Dhaka covering low income settlements within 1km of the riverbank. The survey was administered to 1826 households randomly selected from 10 communities. The survey was administered in Bangla through an electronic form developed in ONA (https://ona.io/)\, and was conducted by 15 trained local enumerators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REACH is a global research programme to improve water security for the poor by delivering world-class science that transforms policy and practice. Living in poverty often means a struggle for water security. Rapid urban growth\, unregulated pollution from industry\, extreme floods and droughts\, lack of reliable and safe drinking water\, and increasing damage to water ecosystems threaten economies and undermine the lives of the poor. Improving water security is an important pathway to sustainable growth and poverty reduction. However\, better evidence is needed to guide institutional and infrastructure investments which unlock growth opportunities and help people move out of poverty. The REACH programme will improve water security for over ten million poor people by: -generating new evidence on water security through an innovative\, interdisciplinary\, risk-based approach -establishing science\, practitioner and enterprise partnerships to ground research in approaches that will benefit the poor building capacity and networks for the next generation of water managers and scientists in Africa and South Asia. REACH is a nine-year programme (2015-2024) led by Oxford University with international consortium of partners and funded with UK Aid Direct from the UK Government&rsquo;s Foreign\, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office.</p>\r\n"

"Bicol Multipurpose Survey (BMS), 1983: [Philippines]","<p>Designed to revisit the residents of the Bicol Region who were surveyed during 1978 in an effort to review the progress of the Bicol River Basin Development Project (BRBDP). Follows the same design as Bicol Multipurpose Survey\, 1978\, with the data being organized into 31 &#39;&#39;blocks&#39;&#39; or series of questions. Respondents were again asked about income\, employment\, education\, health status\, and health services. Additionally\, the 1983 survey gathered extensive information on fishing\, business expenses\, and small business activities\, along with fertility\, pregnancy\, and mortality histories. Due to time and cost considerations\, detailed questions on credit\, some health-related items regarding beliefs\, chronic illnesses\, and breast-feeding\, and detailed questions on crops were not included in the 1983 BMS. Section I\, Household Data (Parts 1-32)\, focused on background information\, transportation\, environment\, morbidity\, and health services. Information was gathered about people living in the household six months prior to the survey as well as people who had left the household five years prior to the survey. Expenditure data on schooling were gathered for individuals 6-30 years of age. Marriage and pregnancy histories were elicited from women aged 15-49 along with family planning and birth interval information. Section II\, Agriculture/Income/Labor Data (Parts 33-87)\, posed questions on employment\, wages\, and hired labor for men\, women\, and children aged 6-15. Data on coconut\, sugar cane\, and abaca crop production were also gathered\, along with information about livestock and poultry\, and extensive data were collected about fishing activities. Fishing boat owners were interviewed\, along with capture fisherman who fished both inland and marine waters.

"Bicol Multipurpose Survey (BMS), 1978: [Philippines]","<p>Designed to assess the impact of the Bicol River Basin Development Project (BRBDP) on one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. Using data collected from both semi-urban and rural areas of the Bicol Region\, the BMS sought to examine the impact not only of the various development projects of the BRBDP such as irrigation\, electricity\, and road repair\, but also the economic\, social\, and health issues faced by the residents of the Bicol Region. The survey gathered data for 17 project areas and 3 cities in the provinces of Albay\, Camarines Sur\, and Sorsogon. Household-level information (Part 1) covers household characteristics\, physical environment\, income and expenditures\, distance from schools\, and respondents&#39; feelings about household conditions and the progress of the barangay in which they lived (a barangay is a political subdivision equivalent to a village in rural areas and to a neighborhood in urban areas). Information on topics such as attitudes about foods during pregnancy\, infant and child care\, prenatal care\, community involvement\, and work history are contained in a separate Mothers Data file (Part 2). The individual-level data (Parts 3-5) contain demographic information such as age\, sex\, and education\, and include time spent on household and occupational tasks. Information was collected from persons as young as 6 years of age\, but was coded for individuals 15 years and older for tasks such as selling\, food preparation\, farm work\, raising livestock and poultry\, and the type and amount of fishing. Morbidity data from over 17\,000 individuals are also included. The Household Production files (Parts 6-11) cover agriculture and business\, crop production\, rice farming\, raising livestock and poultry\, type of fishing done\, and quantity of fish caught. Also included are income figures\, assets\, and liabilities. The Barangay Survey (Part 12) examines the physical aspects of the barangay and the use of social services in the area to determine the impact of the BRBDP and outside influences. The barangay captain or official records provided information on the physical characteristics\, community services\, medical services\, social services\, sanitation\, and educational systems available within the barangay. The Extension Workers Survey (Part 13) asked 324 workers about their knowledge and activities regarding agricultural practices such as fertilizer use\, pest and disease control\, and other aspects of planting and transplanting. Through the Medical Practitioners Survey (Part 14)\, 426 practitioners were asked questions on their education and training\, general health knowledge and experience\, and knowledge and attitudes about birth control. Data collected in 1978\, 1983\, and 1994 can be used individually or merged together on a unique household identifier found in Part 15 (with the exception of the Medical Practitioners and Extension Workers data).</p>\r\n"
"Land Use, Agropastoral Production, Family Composition, and Household Economy in Santarem, Para, Brazil, June-August 2003 (ICPSR 34347)","<p>Consists of 8 interconnected datasets and 1 linking file. The primary unit of analysis is the rural property or lot. Each lot in the sample contains a minimum of 1 household with a mean of 1.33 households per lot in the final sample. Within households\, data were collected on subsets of individuals as well as additional properties used by the households in the study. These 2003 Santarem data come from interviews with farm families in an agricultural zone south of the city of Santarem in the Brazilian state of Para. The study region is adjacent to the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers and the northern terminus of the BR-163 (the Cuiaba-Santarem Highway). BR-163 links intensive agropastoral production (particularly mechanized soybean farming) in the state of Mato Grosso to Santarem\, where the multinational corporation Cargill runs a deepwater port (opened in 2003) for loading soybeans onto oceangoing ships. The opening of this port has accelerated the process of urbanization and led to a transformation from a landscape of small family farming to a landscape of mechanized agriculture. The discourse on deforestation has focused on the alarming rates of deforestation in the Amazon Basin to the neglect of the dynamic and reciprocal influences between the human population and the environment. This study investigated 5 basic questions: (1) Does the changing availability of household labor over the household life cycle affect the trajectory of deforestation and land use change in the same way for later generations of Amazonian farmers as for first generation in-migrants? (2) What are the determinants of changing household labor supply? Specifically\, what are the biophysical and socioeconomic determinants of entries into and exits from the household through fertility\, migration\, and marriage? (3) How are the decisions of households regarding land use and labor allocation constrained by soil quality\, access to water supplies\, interannual drought events (e.g. El Nino type events)\, and other resource scarcities? (4) Are there notable differences in land use choices made by landholders who live in an urban area (away from the piece of land owned in the rural area) in contrast to the decisions made by those who live on their rural properties? (5) What are the bases for the precipitous decline in female fertility in these frontier regions\, especially the use of sterilization after two pregnancies? Households will be surveyed in the Santarem region\, in the Lower Tapajos Basin\, Brazilian Amazon to collect detailed demographic\, land-use histories\, and economic data. The sampling of households for inclusion in the study will be based on a stratified random sample by period of occupation in Santarem\, to capture intergenerational processes that preceded the availability of satellite images. Based on the particular combination of methodologies used in this investigation (traditional household surveys\, satellite image analysis\, and GIS\, and the scaling up and down from households to landscape)\, future environmental changes were projected for the regional landscape under various scenarios of continued settlement\, household life cycles\, combinations of credit\, and changing environmental conditions.</p>\r\n"
Asian Elephant Vocalizations,"<p>&nbsp;Asian Elephant Vocalizations\, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2010S05 and isbn 1-58563-557-X\, consists of 57.5 hours of audio recordings of vocalizations by Asian Elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) in the Uda Walawe National Park\, Sri Lanka\, of which 31.25 hours have been annotated. Voice recording field notes were made by Shermin de Silva and Ashoka Ranjeewa\, of the Uda Walawe Elephant Research Project. The collection and annotation of the recordings was conducted and overseen by Shermin de Silva\, through the University of Pennsylvania Department of Biology\, and Institute for Research in Cognitive Science. The recordings primarily feature adult female\, and juvenile elephants. Existing knowledge of acoustic communication in elephants is based mostly on African species (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>). There has been comparatively less study of communication in Asian elephants\, primarily becaUse the habitat in which Asian elephants typically live makes them more difficult to study than African forest elephants. For other current elephant vocalization research\, see&nbsp;<a href=""http://elephantvoices.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">ElephantVoices</a>&nbsp;and the Cornell Lab of Ornithologys&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/"" rel=""nofollow"">Elephant Listening Project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This corpus is intended to enable researchers in acoustic communication to evaluate acoustic features and repertoire diversity of the recorded population. Of particular interest is whether there may be regional dialects that differ among Asian elephant populations in the wild and in captivity. A second interest is in whether structural commonalities exist between this and other species that shed light on underlying social and ecological factors shaping communication systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Study site and subjects</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Uda Walawe National Park (UWNP)\, Sri Lanka\, is located at latitude 630&deg;14.0646N\, longitude 80&deg;5428.1268E\, and an average altitude of 118 m above sea level. It occupies 308 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and contains tall grassland\, dense scrub\, riparian forest\, secondary forest\, rivers and seasonal streams. It also contains several natural and man-made water sources and reservoirs with seasonal floodplains. There are two monsoons per calendar year\, separated by dry seasons of variable length. Over 300 adult females have been individually identified in UWNP using characteristics of the ears\, tail\, and other natural markings (Moss\, 1996).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Data collection</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Data were collected from May\, 2006 to December\, 2007. Observations were performed by vehicle during park hours from 0600 to 1830 h. Most recordings of vocalizations were made using an Earthworks QTC50 microphone shock-mounted inside a Rycote Zeppelin windshield\, via a Fostex FR-2 field recorder (24-bit sample size\, sampling rate 48 kHz) connected to a 12 V lead acid battery. Recordings were initiated at the start of a call with a 10-s pre-record buffer so that the entire call was captured and loss of rare vocalizations minimized. This was made possible with the pre-record feature of the Fostex\, which records continuously\, but only saves the file with a 10-second lead once the record button is depressed. In order to minimize loss of low-frequency or potentially inaudible calls\, recording was continued for at least three minutes following the end of vocalization events. During the first two months\, hour-long recording sessions were also carried out opportunistically while in close proximity to a group. However\, spectrograms showed that few vocalizations were captured therefore\, this was discontinued.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\r\n"

"Environmental change in Nyangatom, South Omo Zone, Ethiopia, before and after the Gibe III dam 2017-2019","<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dataset integrates data from qualitative and quantitative participatory methods\, along with remote sensing data to map changes in ecosystem services. This approach enabled us to develop a holistic understanding of what ecosystem services are available in the landscape\, where they are located\, how they are valued by local communities\, and how and why they are changing. Participatory mapping with groups of participants from communities in our focal area created fine-scale data that allowed us to understand both ecosystem services supplied by very specific locations (i.e.\, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services from a specific tree or bend in the river) as well as the capacity and value of a range of ecosystem services(ES) from particular land cover types. The integration of TEK with remote sensing data was critical for scaling this information up to the landscape level. Additionally\, the use of historic satellite imagery allowed us to investigate long-term change in provisioning ES and triangulate this with perceived changes identified by the communities. In this geographic context\, such mixed methods were also important given the lack of other ecosystem service studies. In a politically sensitive region\, the co-production of knowledge with the community allowed us to build trust with the community whilst ensuring their perspectives were integrated with equal weight to the remote sensing data\, and resulting in a deeper understanding of both datasets and the ES dynamics of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rapid changes in the natural\, social\, and economic environment are occurring in Ethiopia&#39;s Lower Omo Valley\, as part of a state-led development vision of repositioning the region as a major sugar exporter. At the same time\, these changes raise risks of environmental degradation\, and the emergence of new kinds of inequality and conflict. The Lower Omo is home to a large number of pastoralist groups\, and is a major centre of ethnic\, linguistic and cultural diversity - reflected in its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Schlee\, 2009; Turton\, 1991). While new sugar estates promise to create 150\,000 new jobs\, they are also drawing labour migrants from other regions\, setting up new hierarchies of wealth and opportunity\, and raising social tensions (Tewolde and Fana\, 2014). As part of its ambitious Growth and Transformation Plans (FDRE 2010\, 2015)\, Ethiopia&#39;s government has allocated 175\,000 hectares to the sugarcane project (more than the entire area under irrigation in Kenya)\, and aims to increase national sugar production from 17 million to 42 million tons. Pastoralists who\, according to the government\, do not use the land optimally\, have had their &quot;underutilized&quot; lands re-purposed for sugarcane plantations and industrial sites that will produce sugar worth 661.7 million USD and produce alternative energy sources (304\,000m3 of ethanol per year and 607 MW electricity). This scenario raises urgent questions about the social justice dimensions of current development models\, and their implications for socio-ecological resilience. The following interlinked research questions will structure our exploration of the on-going changes and their consequences: 1. How have recent developments affected the spatial and temporal availability of and access to natural resources in the region? (Environmental sustainability / degradation) 2. How are changing resources affecting conflict dynamics in the region? (Conflict and resilience) 3. How are these changes influencing relations of material in/equality? (Wealth and poverty / resource security). These questions will be addressed by three working groups with expertise in the fields of environmental sustainability\, conflict studies\, and poverty research respectively. The group will first conduct research involving knowledge generation across disciplines and stakeholder groups\, and second work towards application in the form of knowledge exchange and synthesis. The first step in the research design will accommodate a cycle of stakeholder identification\, scoping and testing of research assumptions; followed by an intensive period of data collection using both conventional (survey\, focus group) and participatory research methods. Crucially\, our tools will include participatory video methods that will be used to stimulate conversations about current models of development that are rarely possible due to barriers of language\, distance\, and power. The project will thereby facilitate knowledge sharing\, processing\, and utilisation\, and explore how knowledge regarding the environmental changes and their implications for poverty\, peace\, and security is best integrated in decision-making for diverse stakeholders.</p>\r\n"
"Longitudinal Sanitation Data From High-Frequency Phone Surveys Across Three Countries, 2020-2024","<p>This dataset relates to a study exploring off-grid sanitation practices in Kenya\, Peru\, and South Africa\, with a focus on how various user demographics access and utilize sanitation facilities. The study contrasts container-based sanitation with alternative methods. Participants\, acting as citizen researchers\, gathered confidential information using a specialized mobile application. The primary objective was to uncover obstacles and challenges\, with the intention of sharing insights with other municipalities interested in implementing container-based sanitation solutions for off-grid regions. Over the course of 12 months\, participants received incentives for consistent involvement\, following a micro-payment for micro-tasks model. Selection of participants was randomized\, involving attendance at a training session and\, if necessary\, provision of a smartphone which they retained at the conclusion of the project. Weekly smartphone surveys were conducted in more than 300 households within informal settlements across the three countries throughout the project duration. These surveys aimed to capture daily routines\, well-being\, income levels\, usage of infrastructure services\, livelihood or environmental shocks and other socioeconomic factors on a weekly basis\, contributing to more comprehensive analyses and informed decision-making processes. The smartphone-based methodology offered an efficient and adaptable means of data collection\, facilitating broad coverage across diverse geographical areas and subjects\, while promoting regular engagement. Open Data Kit (ODK) tools were utilized to support data collection in resource-limited settings with unreliable connectivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect human health and the environment\, sanitation systems must separate people from their excreta and treat it. This does not just involve technologies but other aspects like finance\, government policies and human behaviours must be considered. Sewers and wastewater treatment plants can assist in providing safe sanitation\, but they are expensive and challenging to build\, particularly in dense urban areas or where people do not own the land that they live on. In fact\, only 45% of the world&#39;s urban population have safely managed sanitation; that is where human waste is treated before disposal. Many of these people are instead using off-grid options for sanitation\, such as pit latrines and septic tanks. These are physically difficult to empty\, especially in areas of high population density\, on steep slopes or with a high water table\, and pose significant health hazards. The collected waste is often dumped illegally\, frequently into water sources. Off grid solutions can only manage waste safely if the waste collection\, treatment and disposal is properly considered. This research will focus on an emerging off-grid sanitation option in the form of container-based sanitation (CBS) across four city contexts where the provision and regulation of CBS is done by different organisations. In Cap Haitien (Haiti)\, CBS is provided by an NGO\, in Lima (Peru) it is provided by a private company\, in Cape Town (South Africa) it is provided by the municipality and in Kakuma Refugee camp (Kenya) it is provided by a private company working with an NGO. A refugee camp is included as in the future\, refugees driven by climate and other factors will make up a significant proportion of the world&#39;s urban population. Interviews will be conducted with the staff working for the CBS provider as well as other organisations that they work closely with\, e.g.\, local government\, water utilities and regulators. To capture the feelings and opinions of the people using the CBS toilets\, as well as people using other off-grid sanitation options like pit latrines\, a novel smartphone data collection will be used. Participants will complete a short survey several times a week to capture aspects of their mental well-being. In addition\, the data collected will reveal whether current regulations and policies support CBS and whether CBS increases disparities or decreases them. For example\, does CBS without a permanent infrastructure make users feel more vulnerable to eviction\, and is the collection of the containers a burden? Or does it give access to people who would not otherwise be able to use a toilet? The project will also look at the links with other sectors\, specifically waste\, energy\, transport and solid waste\, as if CBS coverage is increased these services will be impacted. For example CBS relies on road transport and cause additional traffic. But the use of CBS stops the disposal of waste into rivers so water supplies are cleaner. Lessons from the project will be shared with other cities who are thinking about implementing CBS\, and with other sectors who are working out how they might deliver their services &quot;off-grid&quot;. Co-I&#39;s have been identified that have expertise beyond sanitation in urban services\, and results will be linked and presented at the GCRF Urban Risk Resilience Hub to look more broadly at lessons for off-grid cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA.</p>\r\n"
"Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Hydrological Processes in Usangu Catchment of Tanzania, 2020","<p>To obtain a free account please <a href=""https://libguides.princeton.edu/UKDS"">register</a> with the UKDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Climate change is anticipated to have long-term effects on hydrological processes and patterns that lead to water stress in agro-ecological catchments. Climate change escalates water scarcity in the Usangu catchment\, evidenced by drying up of rivers during dry season. Therefore\, this study was undertaken to assess climate change impacts on hydrology by utilizing SWAT model and an ensemble mean of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) emission scenarios. Downscaling of GCMs was performed by LARS-WG statistical downscaling tool. In comparison to the baseline period\, short rain intervals are expected to occur between 2030 and 2060\, with mean annual precipitation increase of 7% and 17% in SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 respectively. Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to rise by 0.6&deg;C-2&deg;C. Corresponding to future temperature increase\, evapotranspiration would increase to about 30% and decrease more water yield and groundwater recharge by 7% and 26% in SSP 2-4.5 than in SSP 5-8.5. However\, the effect of precipitation increase is shown by increased surface runoff and streamflow during wetter months. These findings provide watershed managers with crucial information for planning and managing the catchment in light of a changing climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustainable water resource development remains elusive because development has largely externalized costs to the environment and vulnerable people. There is a need for novel research theory\, methodologies &amp; practice in order to meet the UN SDGs and realise the Africa Water Vision 2025. We propose to launch an innovative research approach: the Adaptive Systemic Approach (ASA). Our aim is to apply transformative\, transdisciplinary\, community-engaged research\, to shift water development outcomes towards achieving the SDGs. We focus on continental water development priorities: water supply and pollution. This collaboration brings together the ARUA Water Centre of Excellence (CoE) and UK partner\, the University of Sheffield (UoS). The 8 CoE nodes are: i) Addis Ababa U\, Ethiopia; U Rwanda\, Rwanda; U Cheikh Anta Diop\, Senegal; Dar es Salaam U\, Tanzania\, Makerere U\, Uganda (DAC least developed); ii) U Lagos\, Nigeria (DAC lower-middle income); and iii) U Cape Town\, Rhodes U (CoE Hub)\, South Africa (DAC upper-middle income). We propose a country-based Case Study structure to support local research development and pathways to local impact (Figure 1 in Case for Support). We use an SDG6 (water and sanitation) centred model\, that links SDGs related to landscape water resources with SDGs related to water services. (This model underpins the successful UKRI:GCRF Capability Grant:&quot;Water for African SDGs&quot;). We raise three research questions (RQ) related to water development priorities. Three catchment-based Case Studies address RQ1: HOW IS WATER USED\, TO WHOSE BENEFIT? (Rufigi R Tanzania\, Senegal R Senegal\, and Blue Nile R Ethiopia). Two Case Studies focus on urban water pollution (Kampala City Uganda and Lagos City Nigeria)\, addressing RQ2: WHAT ARE THE SOURCES\, PATHWAYS AND IMPACT OF POLLUTION IN URBAN WATER SYSTEMS? A cross-cutting Case Study addresses water resource protection and biodiversity in all CSs\, and a biodiversity site in Rwanda. By the completion of the project we commit to leaving local people effectively linked with institutions making decisions about water that affect them. Therefore all Case Studies address the question RQ3: HOW CAN LOCAL CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE BE DEVELOPED FOR: I) EQUITABLE WATER SHARING\, II) COMMUNITY POLLUTION RESILIENCE\, AND III) ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION AND RESTORATION? The novel Adaptive Systemic Approach (ASA) provides a coherent methodological framework that will support Case Study comparisons\, changed water development practice\, and will embed pathways to impact throughout the project. The ASA requires engaged research\, and draws on three core theoretical concepts\, with associated methods: Complex Social-Ecological Systems\, Transdisciplinarity\, and Transformative Social Learning (Elaborated in Case for Support). These concepts underpin four ASA steps\, followed in each Case Study: 1. BOUND: Researchers engage with a full range of stakeholders to identify a relevant\, local\, water-development issue\, and scope the Case Study. 2. ADAPTIVE PLANNING PROCESS: Stakeholders co-create a contextually informed vision of the future state of their selected local issue\, and co-develop an objectives hierarchy to move towards resolving the issue. 3. CONCURRENT ACTIVITIES 3.1 RESEARCH Each Case study team addresses the specific research questions\, delivering data for resolving the problem. 3.2 PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT Local people\, formal\, and traditional\, water governance institutions together move towards local people being part of land and water decision-making. 3.3 STRATEGIC ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT (SAM) - stakeholders will be trained in a process for systemic\, responsive\, contextual\, co-management. 4. PARTICIPATORY MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF REFLEXIVE LEARNING Researchers and stakeholders co-develop indicators\, co-monitor\, co-reflect on progress\, co-learn and adapt\, using SAM. Following the ASA in the case studies embeds the theory of change\, and the pathways to impact.</p>\r\n"
